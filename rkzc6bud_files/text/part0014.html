<p class="non_para">It can be hard to be a mom. Especially when a tattooed biker size extra-large knocks on your front door looking for your teenage sons. Uh-oh. But, no, he’s not here to rumble. As reported in the <i class="calibre4">New York Times</i>, the two boys got on a CB radio, made a friend, and invited him over. Just another crazy thing teenagers do? Actually, no. Those twins are part of a special group of people: the friendliest people in the world.</p>
<p class="in_para">They’re a small, little-known group. They absolutely love people, and they’re almost infinitely trusting, with zero social anxiety. Meet a member of this clan, and they will immediately shower you with compliments, questions, and kindness. And it’s all totally heartfelt and sincere. As Jennifer Latson recounted in <i class="calibre4">The Boy Who Loved Too Much</i>, these people make you feel so special it’s almost a disappointment when you realize they’re like this with everyone. No, they’re not part of a cult. No, they’re not selling anything. But, of course, there is a twist . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder. Perhaps the most endearing of disorders. What is fascinating is that while people with this condition are disabled, they are also superhumanly <i class="calibre4">abled</i> when it comes to kindness, empathy, and socializing.</p>
<p class="in_para">Affecting just one in ten thousand people worldwide, Williams syndrome (WS) occurs when roughly twenty-eight genes are missing on chromosome number seven. This causes changes in the fetus, including shorter stature, connective tissue problems, and unique facial features.</p>
<p class="in_para">Unfortunately, WS also causes intellectual disability. The average IQ is sixty-nine. But from a scientific perspective, the mental <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84" title="84"></span>challenges are inconsistent. Those with WS possess what the literature calls an “uneven cognitive profile.” They have trouble in some areas—but superpowers in others. They have extreme difficulty with math and solving puzzles, but ask them a question and you’ll be treated to an amazing storyteller who uses rich, emotional wording. Their performance on abstract and spatial tasks is dismal, yet they excel with things verbal, emotional, or even musical.</p>
<p class="in_para">When scientists tracked down what was responsible for the asymmetry in deficits, they got a lot more than they bargained for. They realized that they weren’t just studying a medical malady but beginning to crack the code of human kindness. MRI scans showed that WS folks have “diminished amygdala reactivity in response to socially frightening stimuli.” In English: people with Williams syndrome never see faces as unfriendly. You and I are skeptical, or even fearful, of strangers. For people with Williams, there truly are no strangers: just friends they haven’t met yet.</p>
<p class="in_para">But what caused their brains to develop so differently? Given it’s a genetic disorder, the researchers looked hard at the DNA for these “superfriendly” genes. And found them. GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 modulate oxytocin, that bonding hormone you’ve heard so much about. In WS, these genes basically send oxytocin into overdrive. If you’ve ever felt that surge of maternal or paternal love, or had an experience with the drug Ecstasy, you’ve felt something akin to what nearly <i class="calibre4">every</i> social encounter is like for someone with WS.</p>
<p class="in_para">But the insights didn’t stop there. Think about the traits we’re discussing: always happy to see others, eager to please, infinitely forgiving, and radiating a deep love for others that’s unquestionably sincere. Those are all the qualities that make us cherish, well . . . puppies. And if you thought that, you deserve an honorary PhD in genetics. Because the same genes that separate us <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85" title="85"></span>from those with Williams are the same genes that distinguish wolves from man’s best friend. And this might explain why you and I can be afraid of or hostile to strangers outside our “pack,” while two twins with WS will talk to a Hells Angel on a CB radio and invite him over.</p>
<p class="in_para">Alysson Muotri, a professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine, has studied WS: “I was fascinated on how a genetic defect, a tiny deletion in one of our chromosomes, could make us friendlier, more empathetic and more able to embrace our differences.” It’s not much of a stretch at all to say that people with WS possess the qualities most religions urge us to aspire to: a generous, selfless love for all. Latson writes, “People with Williams don’t have to learn the Golden Rule; they don’t have to be taught about equality or inclusion. They’re born practicing these principles.”</p>
<p class="in_para">A 2010 study examined racism among kids with Williams. The result? They don’t show any. Zero, zip, zilch, nada. And this is even more surprising because nearly all children by age three show a preference for their own race. Kids with WS are, in fact, the only children ever found to show zero racial bias.</p>
<p class="in_para">All of these prosocial, altruistic traits led Karen Levine, a developmental psychologist at Harvard Medical School, to half-jokingly propose <i class="calibre4">we’re</i> the ones with the disorder. She calls it TROUS: “The Rest of Us Syndrome.” Symptoms include hiding our emotions, not treating strangers as friends, and an epic lack of hugging.</p>
<p class="in_para">If anything, those with WS are <i class="calibre4">too</i> trusting. They frequently get taken advantage of. It’s like they possess no social immune system to defend them. This presents a problem for parents of WS kids. While such a friendly child is a beautiful thing, having them happily hop into cars with strangers is not. These children must be taught to distrust others—but the lessons rarely stick. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86" title="86"></span>It’s not in their nature. And while such threats make mothering a WS child an extreme challenge at times, Latson notes the upside: What mom doesn’t want a little boy who sincerely tells her he loves her at least a dozen times a day—no matter what she does?</p>
<p class="in_para">Maybe WS folks are nature’s way of apologizing for sociopaths. That’s kinda how Stanford School of Medicine professor Robert Sapolsky sees it: “Williams have great interest but little competence. But what about a person who has competence but no warmth, desire or empathy? That’s a sociopath. Sociopaths have great theory of mind. But they couldn’t care less.”</p>
<p class="in_para">However, that interest without competence leads to a heart-breaking irony for those with WS: they long for real connection but are often unable to achieve it. What they possess in social desire is not matched in social ability. They fail at processing many basic social cues. They ask repetitive questions and are often too impulsive to wait for answers before asking another one. Fearless about initiating relationships, they lack the ability to deepen and sustain them. Roughly 80 percent of WS kids felt that they lacked friends or had difficulties with their friends. They are the sweet child that everyone is nice to . . . but that no one invites to birthday parties.</p>
<p class="in_para">And from a happiness perspective, the “uneven cognitive profile” that gives them superpowers can actually be worse than having more severe deficits. It is a cruel tragedy to know you have a problem—but be forever lacking the capacity to solve it. To watch others acquire friends, partners, and eventually children but to experience only frustration and loneliness yourself. As science writer David Dobbs said about those with Williams: “They know no strangers but can claim few friends.”</p>
<p class="in_para">So what happens when your WS twins invite that biker over and he’s standing on your doorstep? Dobbs recounted this true <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87" title="87"></span>story for the <i class="calibre4">New York Times</i>. Well, you reluctantly welcome Mr. Hells Angel in for a while. And he’s so taken with the two most gregarious, friendly kids he’s ever met that he asks if you’ll bring them to his biker club to speak to the crew. Which is just about the greatest thing your sons could ever hope for. So you say yes. And you’re scared that day because the clubhouse looks like the waiting room for a parole office. But your boys could not be more excited: <i class="calibre4">Look at all the people, mom!</i> And they give their little presentation. They talk about how much they love conversations. How badly they get bullied. How confusing the world is to them at times. And how they struggle so very, very hard to just make a real friend. You’re scared the bikers will be bored or angry—but that’s not what happened at all that day . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">The mother in question turned to look at the audience and what she saw was a room full of enormous tattooed men wiping tears from their faces.</p>
<p class="in_para">And no matter what happens today, tomorrow those with Williams will keep loving us all, fearlessly representing the best parts of humanity.</p>
<p class="in_para">Many of us have had moments in our lives where we could relate to aspects of WS. We struggle to make and sustain deep friendships, despite being kind and friendly. And when it doesn’t click, we wonder what we’ve done wrong. Or if there’s something wrong with us.</p>
<p class="in_para">But the struggles of those with WS actually contain the secret we need to form those true friendships Aristotle wrote about . . .</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">When it comes to making friends, the closest thing we have to the magic powers of Williams syndrome seems to be the work of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88" title="88"></span>Dale Carnegie. Since it was first published in 1936, <i class="calibre4">How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> has sold over thirty million copies, and nearly a century later it still sells more than a quarter million copies each year. Carnegie’s text intersperses stories with information on how to be better with people and obviously bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book you’re reading right now.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what does Dale recommend? He encourages people to listen, to be interested in others, to speak to them from their point of view, to sincerely flatter others, to seek similarity, to avoid conflict, and many other things that seem obvious—but that we all routinely forget to do. However, Carnegie’s book was written before the dawn of most formal research in the area and is largely anecdotal. Does his advice line up with modern social science?</p>
<p class="in_para">Surprisingly, yes. As ASU’s Hruschka notes, the majority of Carnegie’s fundamental techniques have been validated by numerous experiments. One of his methods (which has been shown to promote the feeling of “another self”) is seeking similarity. Ever watch someone get physically hurt and you flinch sympathetically? MRI studies by neuroscientist David Eagleman show that sympathetic pain is increased when we perceive the victim as being similar to ourselves, even if the grouping is arbitrary. Social scientist Jonathan Haidt comments, “We just don’t feel as much empathy for those we see as ‘other.’”</p>
<p class="in_para">That said, good ol’ Dale did get one wrong. The eighth principle in his book says “Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.” Remember back in section 1 when we realized just how terrible we are at reading other people’s minds? Yeah, exactly. Nicholas Epley tested Dale’s suggestion and doesn’t mince words about it: “Never have we found any evidence that perspective taking—putting yourself in another person’s shoes and imagining the world through his or her eyes—increased accuracy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89" title="89"></span>in these judgments.” Not only isn’t it effective, but it actually makes you <i class="calibre4">worse</i> at relating to them. Sorry, Dale.</p>
<p class="in_para">But he was only wrong about that one issue. In his defense, millions have used his techniques with great success including famous people like, um . . . Charles Manson. And this leads us to the more relevant problem with Carnegie’s techniques: not that they’re unscientific, but that they can be manipulative and lead to shallow friendships, the kind Aristotle was none too fond of. (Countdown to lawsuit from the Carnegie estate: five, four, three . . .)</p>
<p class="in_para">Carnegie’s book is great for the early stages of relationships, it’s excellent for transactional relationships with business contacts . . . but it’s also a wonderful playbook for con men. It’s not focused on building “another self” and developing long-term intimacy: it’s much more about tactically gaining benefit from people. Carnegie frequently uses phrases like “human engineering” and “making people glad to do what you want.” To be fair, Carnegie repeatedly says you should have good intentions, but this rings hollow. Sociologist Robert Bellah wrote, “For Carnegie, friendship was an occupational tool for entrepreneurs, an instrument of the will in an inherently competitive society.” If you’re looking for a blood brother or sister from another mister, this isn’t going to do it. It’s the equivalent of using a “How to Pick Up Girls” book to navigate the ups and downs of a multidecade marriage.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what <i class="calibre4">does</i> produce deep, “another self” friendships? This leads us to an area of academic study called “signaling theory.” Let’s say I tell you I’m a tough guy. Do you believe me? On the other hand, let’s say you see the UFC heavyweight championship belt being wrapped around my waist at the end of a televised fight. Which would better convince you I’m not the guy you want to mess with?</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90" title="90"></span>A “costly” signal is a more powerful signal. Saying I’m a tough guy is easy. Me faking a live UFC event before a crowd of thousands is far harder. We operate based on signaling theory all the time; we’re just rarely aware of it. Carnegie teaches us friendship signals, but they’re not costly. That’s why as a reader we like them; they’re easy to do. That’s also why con men like them; they’re easy to fake. Saying “I’ll be there for you” is one thing. Showing up for a full day of helping you move is a much more costly, and powerful, signal. Which would convince you I’m a real friend?</p>
<p class="in_para">So which costly signals do we want to display (and look for) when it comes to true friends? The experts firmly agree on two, the first one being <i class="calibre4">time</i>. Why is time so powerful? Because it’s scarce, and scarce = costly. Want to make someone feel special? Do something for them you simply cannot do for others. If I give you an hour of my time every day, I cannot do that for more than twenty-four people. Cannot. End of discussion. Thank you for calling.</p>
<p class="in_para">As we discussed, friendship beats other relationships in terms of happiness, but what is it specifically that works that magic? Melikşah Demιr of Northern Arizona University says it’s companionship—merely spending time together. And, unsurprisingly, what does research say is the most common cause of conflict in friendships? Once again, time. There’s no getting around it: time is critical.</p>
<p class="in_para">So how do we make more time for friends as an adult? The key comes down to rituals. Think about the people you do keep up with, and you’ll probably find a ritual, conscious or not, underneath it. “We talk every Sunday,” or “we exercise together.” Replicate that. It works. Find something to do together consistently. Research from Notre Dame that analyzed over eight million phone calls showed touching base in some form every two weeks <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91" title="91"></span>is a good target to shoot for. Hit that minimum frequency, and friendships are more likely to persist.</p>
<p class="in_para">But making new friends can require even <i class="calibre4">more</i> time. That process can be slower than inflight internet, which is one reason we’re so bad at it as we age. How much time? Are you sitting down? Jeff Hall’s research found that it took as many as sixty hours to develop a light friendship, sometimes one hundred hours to get to full-fledged “friend” status, and two hundred or more hours to unlock the vaunted “best friend” achievement. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but either way—yowzers, that’s a lot of time.</p>
<p class="in_para">But that’s only part of the equation. Hall also found that <i class="calibre4">how</i> people talked mattered. We’ve all hit that wall with a potential friend where the small talk starts to go in circles. You just can’t seem to break through to the next level. And that’s one problem with Carnegie’s work: the smiling and head bobbing get you only so far. Want to make good friends without dozens of hours? You can do it—but Carnegie won’t get you there. Arthur Aron (who developed the IOS Scale) got strangers to feel like lifelong pals in <i class="calibre4">just forty-five minutes</i>. How? Well, that leads us to our second costly signal: <i class="calibre4">vulnerability</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">It’s ironic: when we meet new people, we often try to impress them—and this can be a terrible idea. Through a series of six studies, researchers found that signaling high status doesn’t help new friendships, it hurts them. Again, might be good for sales calls or conveying leadership, but it makes finding “another self” much more difficult.</p>
<p class="in_para">There’s been a lot of talk about vulnerability lately, but most of us just nod our heads and go right back to trying to seem perfect. Why? <i class="calibre4">Cause it’s really frickin’ scary to put yourself out there.</i> You could be mocked or rejected, or the information could be used against you. Vulnerability gives us flashbacks to worst-case <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92" title="92"></span>scenarios from high school. (Among the Kunyi tribe of Congo, too much self-disclosure is said to make one more susceptible to witchcraft, so perhaps opening up is even more dangerous than you thought.) We know it’s risky. Large-scale studies by Harvard sociologist Mario Luis Small showed that we’re often more likely to tell very personal details to strangers than close friends.</p>
<p class="in_para">We don’t want awful people to exploit our weaknesses, but the irony is that our weaknesses are where trust comes from. In a paper titled “Can We Trust Trust?” Diego Gambetta wrote, “The concession of trust . . . can generate the very behavior which might logically seem to be its pre-condition.” In other words, trust creates trust. The danger of being exploited creates the value inherent in trust, giving it its power. How do you signal you’re trustworthy? By trusting someone else. And then, often, the trust in you creates the trust in them.</p>
<p class="in_para">Vulnerability tells people they’re part of an exclusive club. They’re special to you. Aron found that self-disclosure directly aids in producing “another self.” And that’s how he got people to become best buds in forty-five minutes. (If you want to see the questions that Aron used to produce close friendships that quickly, I’ve posted them for you here: https://www.bakadesuyo.com/aron.)</p>
<p class="in_para">Not only is vulnerability effective, it’s also not quite as dangerous as you think. Psychology has documented the “beautiful mess effect”—that we consistently overestimate how negatively our errors will be perceived. We think we’ll be seen as a moron and exiled to a distant village, but when surveyed, most people see the occasional screw-up as a positive. You make an error and are terrified you’ll be seen as inadequate. But when others make the same error, you’re rarely as judgmental, and it often warms you to that person.</p>
<p class="in_para">What’s the best way to dip your toe in the pool of vulnerability? <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93" title="93"></span>Well, here goes: I’m a man in his late forties who coos at puppy pictures on Instagram and occasionally speaks to them in babytalk. <i class="calibre4">Yes, I write smarty-smart, self-important books about science and I babytalk to pictures of puppies on Instagram.</i> Do you like me less or more? Trust me less or more?</p>
<p class="in_para">So next time you’re with someone you care about, or someone you want to deepen your friendship with, follow <b class="calibre6">The Scary Rule™</b>: <i class="calibre4">If it scares you, say it.</i> You don’t need to go full bore just yet. Don’t confess to any murders at Christmas dinner. Start slow and build. Stretch the bounds of the sensitive things you’re willing to admit about yourself, and, by the same token, ask more sensitive questions than you’re normally comfortable asking. And when your friend admits vulnerable things, do not recoil and scream, “<span class="make_smallcaps">YOU DID WHAT</span>?!?!” Accept them. Then, Daniel Hruschka says, “raise the stakes.” As long as you feel emotionally safe and you’re getting a positive reception, share more. That’s how you build “another self.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Still hesitant about opening up? Then let me put the metaphorical gun to your head: not being vulnerable kills friendships. That same study on the number of hours required to make a friend showed more small talk in a friendship produced a drop in closeness. Oh, and not being open and vulnerable doesn’t just kill friendships: it can also kill <i class="calibre4">you</i>. University of Pennsylvania professor Robert Garfield notes that not opening up prolongs minor illnesses, increases the likelihood of a first heart attack, and doubles the chance it will be lethal.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now, we’re not yet 100 percent on how that “friend in need” maxim should be interpreted, but we’re a lot closer to seeing how it functions and how it can work in practice. Make the time, vulnerably share your thoughts, and raise the stakes. If all goes well, they do the same. This gets us away from transactional relationships. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94" title="94"></span>With trust established, we can ignore costs to a greater degree, as can they. You don’t worry about how big the favor is or what they’ve done for you lately—you’re past that. Now you only have to ask one question: “Are they a friend?” And if they are, you help.</p>
<p class="in_para">Yes, it can be scary. And plenty of people are using Carnegie’s book with manipulative intentions. There are bad people in this world. Like narcissists. But if we’re going to arrive at true friendship, we’re going to swim in the same waters as bad people.</p>
<p class="in_para">How do we deal with them safely—and maybe even make them better people? We can learn a powerful lesson about doing that by looking at a story about the group of people who have most come to define “evil” in the modern world . . .</p>
