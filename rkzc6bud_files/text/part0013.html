<h2 class="chap_num" id="ch7"><span class="right_" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74" title="74"></span><a href="part0003.html#rch7" class="calibre3">7</a></h2>
<p class="non_para">More than anything else, George Price wanted to make a name for himself. He desperately wanted to be known for having done something world-changing. No one doubted that he was brilliant. Some doubted whether he was mentally well, many doubted whether he was a good husband and father, but nobody doubted his brilliance.</p>
<p class="in_para">George’s math skills and creativity were nearly unparalleled. And driven by that relentless desire to be somebody, he had a work ethic that was even more impressive. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and then got a PhD, finishing his thesis in a fifty-nine-hour-no-sleep blitz, hopped up on Benzedrine. He corresponded with five different Nobel laureates, seeking the breakthrough that would put him on the map.</p>
<p class="in_para">Anytime he didn’t feel that he could make history where he was, he would move on. And so George became a “Forrest Gump” of scientific advancement, moving six times in ten years. He worked on the Manhattan Project, helping to create the atomic bomb. Then on to Bell Labs, aiding in the development of the transistor. Next was cancer research. Then he moved again, pretty much single-handedly inventing computer-aided design.</p>
<p class="in_para">He was a man possessed. And that’s not much of an exaggeration; George wasn’t mentally well. His incredible ambition was born of pathology. And so he went from barely seeing his wife and children to finally abandoning them. His demons would allow nothing to stand between him and greatness.</p>
<p class="in_para">But it wasn’t working. He had made notable achievements in disparate fields but nothing that met his incredible standards. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75" title="75"></span>George spiraled into a crisis. He was unemployed. Alone. At forty-five he hadn’t seen his daughters in over a decade. But his tenacity would not subside. He moved again, this time to London. His next area of scientific interest would be beyond ironic . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">He became interested in families. He wanted to know what makes them stick together. (Feel free to do as much Freudian speculation on this one as you like.) And that led him to the bigger question of altruism: <i class="calibre4">Why does anyone help anyone?</i> Darwin’s white whale again. But at least as far as families are concerned, George could make sense of it. Why would you risk your life to help your kids? They carry your genes. So George applied his tremendous math skills to the issue and discovered the exact formula by which Darwin’s theory of natural selection worked. He had never studied genetics in his life. And the math seemed so simple to him that he was certain someone must have already thought of it before.</p>
<p class="in_para">University College London had the number one genetics department in the world. George dropped by and showed them his work. Ninety minutes later he was given the keys to an office and an honorary professorship. What he had done was groundbreaking. You can look up the Price equation on Wikipedia. It still stands today as a major achievement in genetics and evolutionary theory. And, as fate would have it, that office is actually the site where Darwin’s house used to be.</p>
<p class="in_para">George had finally done it. Made his name. Achieved his dream. The thing he had sacrificed everything for. But what he thought was a wish come true turned out to be a curse. George pondered the results of his work. If something doesn’t promote your survival and reproduction, his math shows that evolution will not select for it. But if you do something because it promotes your survival and reproduction, it’s not altruistic. George thought <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76" title="76"></span>to himself, <i class="calibre4">Did I just prove there is no such thing as kindness? If my math is right, the world is a terrible place.</i> He couldn’t accept a world like that. But he was a scientist who was supposed to be devoted to being objective. Why could he not accept that the world might be a selfish place? As biographer Oren Harman told <i class="calibre4">Radiolab</i>, “Because he had been so selfish for much of his life.”</p>
<p class="in_para">The thing that made his name, that he had sacrificed everything for, he now wanted it to go away. To not be true. He had felt guilt over being so selfish, abandoning his little girls. And now his work showed the whole world was selfish. It was nearly too much for him to bear.</p>
<p class="in_para">George couldn’t change the math. But perhaps he could be the change he wished to see in the world. Maybe he could will the math to be wrong with his choices. And so the man who had tenaciously raced around the world thinking only of success and fame, who had abandoned his wife and daughters when they slowed him down, now began going up to people experiencing homelessness in London’s Soho Square, saying, “My name is George. Is there any way I can help you?”</p>
<p class="in_para">He’d buy them food. He’d give them whatever money he had. He let them stay in his apartment. After a life of thinking only about himself, George was now thinking only about others. He was learning to love. But he was going too far. His friends worried about him. He wasn’t well. But his desire to atone, to fight the selfish math of Darwinism he had discovered, took on the same messianic zeal that his quest for fame had. He knew people were taking advantage of him, but he believed that perhaps if he gave away everything he could somehow disprove his theorem.</p>
<p class="in_para">But one man alone can’t save the world. These individuals didn’t all get sober and fix their lives because of him. George was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77" title="77"></span>like a character in a time-travel film who fights to change the future but realizes he cannot alter destiny. When he ran out of money, he too became homeless. But even squatting in an abandoned house with others, he still devoted himself to helping them. He wrote to his daughters telling them he was sorry. He wished he could start over again.</p>
<p class="in_para">There’s no easy way to say this, dear reader, so I’ll be direct: on January 6, 1975, George Price took his own life. Some might say he made himself a martyr to atone. The simple answer is he was not mentally well. George went too far in many areas. Tragically, this was one of them. Many of us would say we don’t want to live in a world without love, kindness, and altruism, where unselfishness is just another form of selfishness. George Price was one of those people. But the story doesn’t end there . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">George knew in his heart that people could be good. You and I know it too. And eventually science caught up to you, me, and George. They didn’t disprove his math; the Price equation is still rock solid in genetics. But studies have shown that we <i class="calibre4">are</i> wired for selfless altruism. Put people in a functional MRI and ask them to think about donating to charity, and the same circuits light up that are triggered by food and sex. Selflessly helping runs as deep in us as survival and procreating. And when researchers Knafo and Ebstein studied how much we were willing to give, they found a strong correlation with the genes that encode for the brain’s oxytocin receptors. Translation? In very Darwinian fashion, altruism is in our genetics. No, there’s not a contradiction; Darwinism and altruism can both exist in harmony.</p>
<p class="in_para">Evolution cares only about consequences, not intentions. Evolution doesn’t care why you do things, just the end result. Let’s say you’re a CEO and graciously give all your employees a one-thousand-dollar bonus. This makes them love you, so they work <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78" title="78"></span>harder. Company profits triple, you’re a success, and as a result you have lots of babies that thrive. Does that mean your action wasn’t altruistic? Of course not. Your intention was to be nice. Our minds don’t need to be thinking “spread genes” all the time. We’ve talked about how our brains weave stories to make sense of the world. Those stories, our intentions, our choices, are our own.</p>
<p class="in_para">On January 22, 1975, a diverse group gathered in London’s St Pancras Cemetery chapel. University professors with genetics PhDs stood next to junkies. They were there to pay their respects to a man who had influenced their lives. One of those still struggling and homeless was wearing a belt George had given him.</p>
<p class="in_para">George Price took his own life because he was not well. But his own actions showed that an individual can be selfless, can choose to do things to help others even when it doesn’t help the helper. George’s intentions were good. He died in a quest to serve others and, in his own way, proved altruism true.</p>
<p class="in_para">But what is that <i class="calibre4">story</i> that our brain tells us about altruism? The one that lets us override our fundamental Darwinian dictates? If we answer that, we’ll have our definition of friendship. And we’ll solve Darwin’s greatest puzzle. And George will be able to rest in peace . . .</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">Okay, this is where I explain the story in our heads that overrides Charlie Darwin’s laws. Yup, that’s what I’m supposed to do here. No doubt. That’s the goal . . . Look, I’ll be honest: this had me stumped. Desperate for answers, I started reading a lot of ancient philosophy. Hold on, it gets worse. I looked at Plato’s <i class="calibre4">Lysis</i>, and even the great Socrates explicitly said that <i class="calibre4">he</i> couldn’t define friendship. Oof.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79" title="79"></span>Finally, I caught a break. Aristotle, the student of the student of Socrates did have a lot to say about friends. He devoted 20 percent of his <i class="calibre4">Nicomachean Ethics</i> to the subject. Transactional relationships based on benefit weren’t real friendships to Aristotle. He was a big, big fan of close friends though. And he even had a heartwarming definition of what one was. To Aristotle, friends “are disposed toward each other as they are disposed to themselves: <i class="calibre4">a friend is another self</i>.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Pretty nice, huh? We treat them so kindly because they’re part of us. What’s interesting is this would also resolve our conundrum. Your brain is like a clever lawyer, twisting the words in Darwin’s contract. Selfishness can actually <i class="calibre4">be</i> altruism—if I believe that you are me.</p>
<p class="in_para">And this concept of another self was so damn catchy that it influenced an enormous amount of Western culture for the next two thousand years, to the point where in my review of classic literature I saw it so frequently I created Eric’s “Friend-as-Another-Self” drinking game.</p>
<p class="in_para">Cicero around 50 <span class="make_smallcaps">B</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">C</span>.? “For a true friend is one who is, as it were, a second self.” <span class="make_smallcaps">DRINK</span>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Edith Wharton in the 1800s? “There is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person, however dear and beloved, but an expansion, an interpretation, of one’s self.” <span class="make_smallcaps">DRINK</span>.</p>
<p class="in_para">And as Mark Vernon notes, in the New Testament it may say “love thy neighbor as thyself,” but if you check the Old Testament Levitical code, it translates as “love thy <i class="calibre4">friend</i> as thyself.” Yes, the concept of another self is even in the Bible. (Forget taking a drink this time; just polish off the whole bottle.)</p>
<p class="in_para">However, I promised you a book backed by science. Aristotle’s concept is brilliant, but Aristotle also wrote about the folly of making all your sacrifices to Zeus, so maybe we should take him <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80" title="80"></span>with a grain of salt. (I reached out to Aristotle for an interview, but he was unavailable for comment.) “Friends are another self” is perfect for Instagram, but alas, it’s not science. So I went back to reading nerdy academic study after nerdy academic study . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But then I came across something: “The support for our basic prediction is consistent with the notion that, in a close relationship, other is ‘included in the self’ in the sense that cognitive representations of self and close others overlap.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Holy crap. Aristotle was right. And he wasn’t just a “little” right or “almost” right; not just one but over <i class="calibre4">sixty-five</i> studies support Aristotle’s idea. In psychology it’s called “self-expansion theory”—that we expand our notion of our self to include those we’re close to. A series of experiments demonstrated that the closer you are to a friend, the more the boundary between the two of you blurs. We actually confuse elements of who they are with who we are. When you’re tight with a friend, your brain actually has to work harder to distinguish the two of you.</p>
<p class="in_para">The clincher was neuroscience studies that put people into an MRI and then asked them questions about friends. Of course, the areas of the brain for positive emotions lit up. You know what else was activated? <i class="calibre4">The parts of the brain associated with self-processing.</i> When women heard the names of their close friends, their gray matter responded the same way it did when they heard their own name.</p>
<p class="in_para">From this work, the IOS (“inclusion of other in the self”) Scale was developed, and it was so powerful that the ranking could be used to robustly determine relationship stability. In other words, tracked over time, lower scores predicted the friendship was more likely to break up, and high scores predicted it was less likely to break up. Beyond that, when friendships with high IOS scores <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81" title="81"></span>did end, subjects were much more likely to say things like “I don’t know who I am anymore.” If you’ve ever had a close friendship end and felt like you lost a part of yourself, well, in a manner of speaking, you were right.</p>
<p class="in_para">In 1980, Harvard professor Daniel Wegner said that empathy might “stem in part from a basic confusion between ourselves and others.” And with that, it seems like we finally have the definitions we’ve been seeking.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li class="bul1">What is empathy? Empathy is when the line between you and another blurs, when you become confused where you end and another person begins.</li>
<li class="bul1">What is closeness? Closeness is when your vision of your “self” scooches over and makes room for someone else to be in there too.</li>
<li class="bul1">What is a friend? A friend is another self. A part of you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="in_para">I have the urge to say, <i class="calibre4">In your face, Charlie Darwin!</i> But the truth is, Darwin was just like us. Remember how he said the problem of altruism was his biggest challenge? How he feared it could disprove his theory? Well, Darwin couldn’t reconcile it himself, but his behavior displayed the same distinction. Darwin did great things and had a whopping ten kids. (Nice way to prove your theory, Charlie.) But to do that, his brain didn’t need to be thinking “must spread genes” all the time. That wasn’t what was important to him as a person. What was?</p>
<p class="in_para">Believe it or not, friendship. Darwin wrote a memoir and discussed the thing that affected his career more than anything else. His theory of natural selection? Nope: “I have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole career more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82" title="82"></span>than any other. This was my friendship with Professor Henslow.” Darwin’s theory didn’t have much to say about friendship, but it played as significant a part in his own life as it does in ours.</p>
<p class="in_para">Friends expand us. Unite us. And as far as our brains are concerned, the people we care about truly do become a part of us. Yes, Darwin’s theory is active in our biology, but our feelings are real. Our intentions can be pure and noble. We can and do make great altruistic sacrifices for friends like Hector Cafferata did.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now we know what friendship, closeness, and empathy are. Friends are a part of you . . . but how do we make them? There’s plenty of work on this topic, most notably Dale Carnegie’s classic text. But does <i class="calibre4">How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> hold up to scientific scrutiny? We’re gonna find out. But before Dale gets the <i class="calibre4">MythBusters</i> treatment, we need to learn a lesson or two from a very special group of folks who just happen to be the friendliest people on Earth . . .</p>
