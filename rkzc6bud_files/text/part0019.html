<p class="non_para">If you have to read some history and you don’t like to read history, read about Casanova. Seriously, this guy’s life was more exciting than most summer movies. Espionage, scandals, high-stakes gambling, assassins, duels to the death, secret societies, betrayal, con artistry, exile. He escaped an inescapable prison and did it <i class="calibre4">by gondola</i>, no less. Casanova hung out with King George III, Catherine the Great, Goethe, Rousseau, and multiple popes. He toured scientific conferences with Ben Franklin and traded barbs with Voltaire. Oh, and of course, he did that which he is most famous for: seduction after seduction after seduction. In his autobiography he writes, “I can say I have lived.” Now there’s the understatement of the millennium.</p>
<p class="in_para">You just cannot imagine how much this guy did, how much trouble he got into, and how many countries he visited, people he scammed, and women he slept with. I’d like to summarize his life for you and do it justice but I can’t. Literally <i class="calibre4">cannot</i>. His autobiography is twelve volumes totaling 3,700 pages—and he even left out the stuff that he thought was “too scandalous.”</p>
<p class="in_para">He was a scoundrel who existed on wit, fearlessness, and charm. Casanova’s life followed a consistent pattern: Befriend powerful people. Start a new career. Get a wealthy patron. Gamble and chase women. Drive everyone crazy, including the authorities. Be thrown in prison or exiled. Move to new city. <i class="calibre4">Repeat.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">He had a “lust for life.” Okay, he lusted for a lot more than life, frankly. And didn’t show a whole lot of remorse, either. He callously went from woman to woman, getting involved in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130" title="130"></span>sordid tales that make Pornhub seem tame, but we’re gonna keep it PG-13 here. Safe to say he was the platonic form of the “bad boy,” a patron saint to pickup artists, bouncing from girl to girl to girl . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But there was one woman who was special. One who stood out. (There always is, isn’t there?)</p>
<p class="in_para">One woman captured and broke the heart of the great Casanova. We know her only as “Henriette.” Her true background is shrouded in mystery. Of course, she was beautiful. But it was how cultured she was that blew him away. She was witty and sophisticated, and it was clear she was slumming by even being with him. A libertine herself, she was so savvy that he assumed she, too, was a grifter. Henriette was every bit his equal in charm and seduction—something Casanova was not accustomed to, to say the least.</p>
<p class="in_para">His was one of the most epically exciting lives in all of history, yet he would say their time together were his happiest moments and the most obsessive love affair of his life. And, even if only briefly, she changed the callous rogue. This legendary charmer of women, the man whose name would be synonymous with seduction, was transformed into the average Joe head over heels for a girl. He obsessed over her. Dreamt about her at night. He even feared he might just be another one of <i class="calibre4">her</i> affairs. And like anyone madly in love, he idealized her.</p>
<p class="in_para">Being around her softened him. Yeah, he was a rogue, but not a psychopath. It’s easy to judge him, but his early life had been far from easy. His father had died when he was just eight. His mother was an actress and prostitute who left him to be raised by his grandmother. Eventually he was abandoned to grow up in a boarding home. “They got rid of me,” he would write. You’d be callous too.</p>
<p class="in_para">Casanova and Henriette’s three months together had all the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131" title="131"></span>makings of an epic romance. They were both fugitives on the run. He was fleeing the Venetian authorities, and she was hiding from her controlling family. She was broke, having nothing but the clothes on her back. And they were men’s clothes to boot. But Casanova was flush. He impulsively bought her a new wardrobe. And a diamond ring.</p>
<p class="in_para">Their pursuers were not far behind. It would have been smart to just lie low and hide out. But Casanova was a man in love with a beautiful woman. He wanted them to have fun. He wanted to show her the world and give her everything. And so they threw caution to the wind and lived it up in the city.</p>
<p class="in_para">But their careless nights on the town would be their downfall. At a lavish party at the Ducal Palace, Henriette was spotted by a relative who confronted her. Casanova blamed himself. Henriette was convinced she would have to return. In their luxurious hotel room in Geneva, she told him they would have to split up. She asked him to never inquire about her and if they saw each other again, he must pretend not to know her. And she left.</p>
<p class="in_para">Casanova spent the two saddest days of his life in that hotel room alone. When he finally got up and opened the drapes, he saw words scratched into the glass of the window. Words scratched with the diamond ring he had bought her. <i class="calibre4">Tu oublieras aussi Henriette.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">Translation: “You will forget Henriette too.”</p>
<p class="in_para">A sad message, for sure. But just seeing something from her was, as he would write, “a balm to my soul.” And not long after, he did receive a letter from her. Henriette was heartbroken, too, but resigned to her fate. She would never have another love, but she wished for him to find another Henriette. Casanova stayed in bed for days with the letter, unable to eat or sleep.</p>
<p class="in_para">A dozen years would pass. There were more adventures, but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132" title="132"></span>now an older man, Casanova was getting tired. Arrested for debts in Switzerland, he had to flee yet again. He questioned his life and came to the conclusion that he should become a monk. That he should retire to a monastery and live a life of . . . Then he saw a pretty girl. The monk idea lasted about a day. (Look, he’s Casanova. What did you expect?)</p>
<p class="in_para">But this, too, was another lesson. He was who he was. The rogue. Nothing had changed. Nothing would change. He returned to Geneva. There would always be another city. Another adventure. Another girl. He entered his fancy hotel room, thinking that maybe Henriette, too, was just another tryst. Nothing special. And as he parted the drapes to the window . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">He realized this was the <i class="calibre4">same</i> hotel room from all those years ago. There on the glass, the words were still scratched: <i class="calibre4">Tu oublieras aussi Henriette.</i> As he would write in his memoir, “I felt my hair stand on end.” The memories flooded back.</p>
<p class="in_para">“You will forget Henriette too.”</p>
<p class="in_para">No. No, he wouldn’t. Yes, there would be more adventures, more women. But for the rest of his life, he would never forget Henriette. To the great Casanova, the seducer of so many, she would always be The One. The only one.</p>
<p class="in_para">The insanity of romantic love renders us all helpless. But what is this thing? And can it last like it did for Casanova?</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">When a prisoner is on death row, you might expect their last words to be something about God or forgiveness. And a survey shows, 30 percent of the time, that is what they say. But the thing they’re most likely to mention, a whopping 63 percent of the time, is romantic love. Family is a distant second.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" title="133"></span>Romantic love may be the best thing in the world. But you don’t need me to tell you that. Its power goes without saying . . . but I’ll say it anyway. The world is infused with magic, and your mind is like someone emptied the kitchen junk drawer onto a trampoline. There’s a reason so much of art and music is about romance. In Dorothy Tennov’s classic study of infatuation, 83 percent of subjects agreed with the statement “anyone who has never been in love is missing one of life’s most pleasurable experiences.”</p>
<p class="in_para">But truth be told, we all know it’s a mixed bag. We’re always up and down. It’s both pleasure and pain. Agony and ecstasy. Delight and despair. Dr. Frank Tallis writes, “Love seems to provide a shuttle service that operates between only two destinations: heaven and hell.”</p>
<p class="in_para">And that’s the side of love we don’t discuss quite as much: <i class="calibre4">love can be awful</i>. A massive multidimensional quantum dumpster fire. <i class="calibre4">Passion</i> derives from the Latin word meaning “to suffer.” While Tennov’s subjects almost unanimously agreed about the pleasures of love, over 50 percent also described horrible depression and a quarter mentioned suicidal thoughts. Love can be almost too powerful a force. Like nuclear energy, it can power an entire city but also annihilate one—and leave lasting radiation.</p>
<p class="in_para">In the 1980s, researcher Shere Hite found that two-thirds of married women and half of unmarried women no longer trusted being in love. This attitude might be unromantic, but it’s far from unprecedented. As we discussed above, the ancients didn’t trust love at all. It’s ironic that when we think of classic love stories, we have positive feelings, considering that most tales of courtly love end in misery and death. (Would you say <i class="calibre4">Romeo and Juliet</i> had a happy ending?)</p>
<p class="in_para">In fact, the ancients didn’t see love merely as bad, they saw it as an <i class="calibre4">illness</i>. Remember how love was mentioned in old Egyptian <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134" title="134"></span>poems? Yeah, those verses were describing it as a malady. We still have a fondness for the work of Jane Austen, like <i class="calibre4">Sense and Sensibility</i>, but in her time sensibility didn’t mean “reasonable.” It meant neurotic. Somebody with too much sensibility was prone to mental health issues.</p>
<p class="in_para">For most of history, from Hippocrates until the 1700s, being “lovesick” was not a metaphor, <i class="calibre4">it was a legitimate diagnosis</i>. This dropped off in the eighteenth century and lost all currency in the nineteenth as the father of psychoanalysis and cocaine afficionado Sigmund Freud turned the conversation to sex. But his attitude toward love wasn’t much different: “Isn’t what we mean by ‘falling in love’ a kind of sickness and craziness, an illusion, a blindness to what the loved person is really like?” And the idea of love as a malady is still with us. When you’re down about love, what do we call it? “Lovesick.” What kind of a romantic is someone? “Incurable.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Your mood is elevated. You barely need to sleep. Self-esteem skyrockets. Thoughts are racing. You’re talkative. Distracted. Socially and sexually you’re more active. You’re willing to take big risks, spend more money, and embarrass yourself. Does that sound like love? Well, actually I was giving you the DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of mania. Yes, modern science basically agrees that love is a mental illness. Psychiatrist Frank Tallis says if you felt all those symptoms above for a week and told a psychiatrist about it (and didn’t mention romance), you might very well walk away with a prescription for lithium. In fact, you’d only need four of those symptoms to qualify.</p>
<p class="in_para">Or are you feeling sad? Lost interest in things you usually enjoy doing? No appetite? Trouble sleeping? Tired? Can’t concentrate? Yeah, that’s being lovesick. But if you have five of those six, you’d also qualify for “major depressive episode” under DSM <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135" title="135"></span>criteria. Feeling both sets of symptoms? Sounds like love to me. It’s also indistinguishable from bipolar disorder. And Tallis, a psychiatrist, says love actually <i class="calibre4">is</i> often misdiagnosed by those in the mental health profession.</p>
<p class="in_para">Making a case for love as a serious medical illness is far easier than you might guess. Let’s not forget how many people kill themselves or others over love. Oddly, though, we don’t take love seriously as a malady and generally see it as something not only benign but widely recommended and endorsed.</p>
<p class="in_para">If we get really scientific, which mental disorder does love best resemble? OCD, actually. You’re obsessed. You can’t control your attention and turn it toward your responsibilities. Anthropologist Helen Fisher reports people newly in love spend up to 85 percent of their waking hours thinking about that special someone. Not only does love meet the criteria for OCD, but the neuroscience data match. Look at a brain in love or an OCD brain in an MRI, and it’s hard to tell the difference. The anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and insula are all working overtime. Psychiatrist Donatella Marazziti took blood from people in love and people with OCD and found both had serotonin levels 40 percent lower than controls. What happens when you test the love group again, months later when the craziness of romance has died down? Serotonin levels are normal again. (Scientist drops mic.)</p>
<p class="in_para">But why would evolution want to give us OCD over someone? What’s the single best framing for the symptoms and behavior of love? Obsession is close, but looking at all the data, the best metaphor is <i class="calibre4">addiction</i>. We’re not washing our hands until they bleed as a semi-arbitrary ritual; we’re in pursuit of something we crave. Ever said, “I can’t get enough of you”? Exactly. High highs and very low lows. Get your fix from a text and you’re good for a while, but soon your junkie soul will need more texts with even more emojis.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136" title="136"></span>Research shows that the love cocktail of phenylethylamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and oxytocin flowing through your love-addled brain provides a high similar to that of amphetamines. And MRI data support the addiction paradigm as well. Juxtapose an fMRI brain scan of someone in love with someone injected with cocaine or morphine, and you see the same pattern. Our old friend Arthur Aron says love is a motivation system. Just like addicts will do anything to get their drug, it’s that same system that tells us go get that special someone.</p>
<p class="in_para">Here we are once again. Yes, I just took the thing most people regard to be the most wonderful part of life and said, “No, it’s like black tar heroin and we’re all just a bunch of mentally ill junkies.” I don’t blame you if you’re thinking, “Barker, I have enjoyed decades of blissful ignorance of these facts and I have no intention of leaving that state today.” I get it. So before everyone reading this book has a collective nervous breakdown, let me give you the much-needed good news.</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">There’s an excellent reason for all the crazy.</i> First (but not necessarily foremost), yeah, evolution wants us to make more humans. That’s priority number one for our genes. We procrastinate about lots of stuff, but evolution will have no trucking with that nonsense. Reproduction is job one, and it flips the logic override switch, saying, “Let me take the wheel; this stuff is important.” As famed playwright W. Somerset Maugham said, “Love is only the dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Evolutionary psychologists are not known to be romantics, but just because love achieves evolution’s goals doesn’t mean it can’t also achieve ours. As with friendship, our brains work with the selfishness of Darwinism to find not only material benefit but also joy and fulfillment. We delude ourselves that friends are part of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137" title="137"></span>us and that the crazy makes life worth living. In fact, our heads are rife with positive biases to counter the ever-present difficulties of the world. You know what psychologists call those optimistic delusions? “Healthy.” Studies have shown people who lack those biases are definitely better at seeing the world accurately. You know what psychologists call those people? “Depressed.”</p>
<p class="in_para">In the short term, not trusting seems like the smart defensive move. It’s often more prudent to do less versus more. We can be lazy and don’t always do what’s good for us. But just like reproduction being job one for evolution, connection is pretty much job one for us as individuals. And so nature forces our hand by making us, well, a bit nuts. Addicts. A motivational drive to reach for more and do more than makes sense because just as hunger ensures we don’t starve from lack of food, the cravings of love make sure we don’t starve emotionally in an often harsh world. We need the crazy to push us to live a good life.</p>
<p class="in_para">Some will counter: “Yeah, we need motivation, but why do we need to go nuts? That doesn’t help.” Actually, it does. In fact, the science shows that being goo-goo gaga out of your mind with love is nothing less than essential. We’ve talked about how painful and scary love can be for you but jeez, get over yourself for a second. You’re not the only one who is scared here. What about that person you’re crushing on? They could get hurt too. What if you’re Casanova, but they’re not Henriette? You think they want their heart broken? So we have a trust problem. A communication problem. In other words, a <i class="calibre4">signaling</i> problem. Remember when we discussed that in the friendship section?</p>
<p class="in_para">So what’s the solution? “Costly signals.” And guess what? Running around like a delusional junkie, endlessly professing your love, acting like a maniac, and throwing caution to the wind as you ignore work, forget to pay the bills, and text your obsession <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138" title="138"></span>three hundred times a day—that’s a pretty clear and costly signal. What do people being wooed often say? “Show me you’re crazy about me.” Bingo. Romantic love not only overrides rationality but also <i class="calibre4">signals</i> the overriding of rationality.</p>
<p class="in_para">As Donald Yates said, “People who are sensible about love are incapable of it.” Irrational loyalty is the only kind that matters. If my loyalty stops when the cost-benefit analysis for me goes south, that’s not loyalty, it’s selfishness. Loyalty is willingness to overpay. Acting crazy in love is signaling to the other person you’re no longer acting out of selfishness; in fact, you’re incapable of that: <i class="calibre4">you can trust me because I’m nuts</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">And at the gut level we know this. We routinely use madness as an indicator of love’s depth. We don’t want romantic love to be rational, and we’re skeptical of rationality in it. Practical and sensible is unromantic. Impractical and wasteful isn’t very sensible but makes the heart sing. Paying someone’s rent is not romantic. But roses, which die and have no long-term value, are. Diamonds are absurdly expensive rocks and have little resale value—<i class="calibre4">extremely</i> romantic. Why pay a lot of good money for flowers or stones that have little practical use and no long-term value? Because it signals you are crazy. The irrationality of love is, ironically, exceedingly rational.</p>
<p class="in_para">And this isn’t just theory. If you lived in a culture that allowed you to easily ditch one person and replace them, would you expect the insanity of love (and its signaling power) to go up or down? Obviously, up. People would be less trusting, and the Cupid parts of your brain would know they’d need to boost the crazy to send a costly signal. And that’s what the study “Passion, Relational Mobility, and Proof of Commitment” found. In cultures where it’s easier to date and ghost, passionate signals were more intense. The crazy is vital.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139" title="139"></span>And that’s not the only upside to love’s insanity. Why do we get so crazy jealous when in love? Because, yet again, that crazy is (within reason) a good thing. Research shows the purpose of jealousy is to protect the relationship. Eugene Mathes of Western Illinois University gave unmarried couples a jealousy test and then circled back seven years later. Three-quarters of them had broken up, while the other quarter got married. Guess which group had the higher jealousy score? Exactly. We feel crazy jealous, even when we don’t want to, because a touch of jealousy can motivate couples to maintain the relationship.</p>
<p class="in_para">And then we have the most important, the most vital, and the most wonderful form of crazy that love brings: idealization. As we all know, people in love idealize their partners. It’s one of the most recognized hallmarks of love. A 1999 study showed that people in happy relationships spend five times as long talking about their sweetheart’s good qualities as bad. As Robert Seidenberg said, “Love is a human religion in which another person is believed in.”</p>
<p class="in_para">You’ve listened to friends idealize a new partner, and they sound utterly crazy. But guess what? You <i class="calibre4">better</i> be crazy. That idealization isn’t just sweet: it also predicts the future better than a crystal ball. “Results of concurrent analyses revealed that relationship illusions predicted greater satisfaction, love, and trust, and less conflict and ambivalence in both dating and marital relationships.” Realism may be accurate, but it’s our illusions that foretell our happiness in love. And the more crazy, the better. People who idealized their partner the most felt no decline in relationship satisfaction over a study of the first three years of marriage.</p>
<p class="in_para">It may sound like I’m recommending that we just disconnect from reality, but that’s not actually how it works. We can see reality <i class="calibre4">and</i> be biased at the same time. When researchers ask people in the throes of infatuation about their partner’s downsides, they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140" title="140"></span>can recognize and identify the bad stuff. They’re not crazy <i class="calibre4">crazy</i>. But they emotionally discount the negative: it’s not a big deal. Or those flaws are even “charming.” This attitude helps grease the wheels of a relationship. We’re just more accommodating when our lovestruck brains dial down our reactions to our loved one’s flaws.</p>
<p class="in_para">But the benefits of crazy idealization don’t stop there. It even prevents cheating at the neuroscience level. If you show photos of good-looking people to men and women in relationships, they’ll acknowledge those folks are good-looking. At a later date, you show them the same photos, but now you say the beautiful person is attracted to them. Guess what? Now they’re less likely to say the person is beautiful. This effect has been replicated time and time again. It’s called “derogation of alternatives.” When people are in love, their brain actually dials down how attractive it sees other people who might threaten the relationship. So when the Ghosts of Hotness Past come around, idealization has your back and makes sure those cute exes aren’t as cute in the eyes of your partner.</p>
<p class="in_para">Remember the people with HSAM, the ones who had a perfect memory for personal events? And how it screwed up their romantic relationships? Well, a study validated this. Lovers who misremembered their histories in a positive way were less likely to split up than people with more accurate recollections. The facts don’t matter as much as the story we tell ourselves when it comes to happiness. We need the crazy. Love is blind—and should be.</p>
<p class="in_para">Needless to say, when idealization is not there, bad things happen. If you’re about to walk down the aisle, you better be feeling the crazy. Women who have second thoughts before they say “I do” are two and half times more likely to be divorced in four years. For men it’s more than a 50 percent increase.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141" title="141"></span>Plain and simple, idealization seems to be the “magic” that’s central to sustaining love. A 2010 study found that “positive illusion” was the single best predictor of holding on to those butterflies in our stomach about someone. But can it “conquer all”? Can it last? Yes. And I don’t mean people just respond to surveys saying, “Oh yeah, we love each other a whole bunch.” You’d expect people to say that, knee-jerk style. But in 2012 social neuroscientist Bianca Acevedo did fMRI brain scans on couples who were married an average of over twenty years. When she showed them pictures of their spouse, some of them did show the same neural responses you see in people who were newly in love. And get this: not only can it last, it can get <i class="calibre4">even better</i>. Not only did these couples show the neural signature associated with having the hots for each other, it actually lacked the anxiety we find in new love. All the good crazy without the bad crazy. Yes, it can last . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But it usually doesn’t. Those couples are the exception. Most of the time romantic love drops off after a year to a year and a half. You see this in the fMRI studies, the serotonin blood tests, and survey data. The addicts become habituated to the drug, and the high wears off. Logically, it’s understandable. Everyone can’t run around like lovestruck maniacs forever. Your head would explode, and the world would burn down. As Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw said, “When two people are under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continuously until death do them part.” It’s pretty unrealistic that the highest of highs can last forever for everyone.</p>
<p class="in_para">Much like the physical universe, love is also subject to entropy. Energy dies down. The frenzy regresses to the mean. Romance <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142" title="142"></span>stories don’t discuss this part; comedians do. On the one hand, it’s good to know this. You’re not necessarily doing anything wrong. A fading of emotions is normal. But it’s still distressing. What did a study of almost 1,100 people in long-term relationships show was the biggest threat to the union? “Fading away enthusiasm.”</p>
<p class="in_para">After the first four years of marriage, satisfaction drops an average of 15–20 percent. (Imagine your salary doing that.) How personally happy are most people two years after getting married? Richard Lucas at Michigan State University found that they’re about as happy as they were before getting married. Regression to the mean. Entropy. You’ve probably heard reports of studies showing cohabiting couples are more likely to divorce. One reason for this is believed to be that they burn through the period of crazy love before settling down to get married. By the time they tie the knot, entropy has already kicked in.</p>
<p class="in_para">This decline doesn’t necessarily spell utter doom. Most couples shift from the crazy of romantic passion to what is known as “companionate love”—a more relaxed, durable feeling of comfort without the fireworks. But idealization fades. A 2001 study found that “idealistic distortion” was cut in half as couples transitioned from engagement to marriage. It’s the rise of love’s mortal enemy: reality.</p>
<p class="in_para">This is best demonstrated by sociologist Diane Felmlee’s research on what she calls “fatal attractions.” Those traits that initially attracted us to our partners often shift in our minds to be seen as negatives. Laid-back becomes lazy. Strong becomes stubborn. Caring becomes clingy. Nearly half of couples surveyed experienced this. As idealization drops, it’s hardly surprising that after four years of marriage, complaints of selfishness more than double.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143" title="143"></span>And less idealization means less “derogation of alternatives.” Your brain stops telling you hot alternative partners aren’t hot. Meanwhile, as a marriage continues, sex almost inexorably declines. Again, the love stories don’t talk about this; comedians do. Believe the comedians. Most couples have sex roughly two or three times a week. But all around the world, the longer you’re married, the less sex you have. In fact, after the first year of marriage, sex declines by half. (If you were expecting wedlock to be a multidecade <i class="calibre4">Eyes Wide Shut</i> party, you’re going to be very disappointed.) The number one Google search related to married problems? “Sexless marriage.” Fifteen percent of married folks haven’t had sex in over six months. (And if you’re someone who is very distressed about inequality in the world, it’s worth noting that 15 percent of people are having 50 percent of the sex.)</p>
<p class="in_para">Yes, sustaining romantic love during a marriage is tough. Actually, it’s even tougher than that: don’t forget survivor bias. All the studies above that look at currently married people are doing just that—<i class="calibre4">only studying the ones that lasted</i>, not the ones that already threw in the towel.</p>
<p class="in_para">Sadly, regular romantic love is not as durable as its more pathological variant: erotomania. No, that disorder is not all about sex. Erotomania is the most extreme form of love, and a recognized mental malady. People with erotomania might do some stalking, but they rarely harm anyone or cause too much trouble. The majority of sufferers are women who believe that a famous man is madly in love with them (despite the fact that he has never met her and has no idea who she is). It’s classified as a delusional disorder in the DSM; obviously more delusional than everyday love, but not the seeing-aliens-and-fairies level of delusion either. Ironically, they display all the qualities we admire in a lover. It ought to be called “Romantic Comedy Disorder.” They never <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144" title="144"></span>give up, never stop believing, and feel that love will conquer all. They are the ultimate romantics. And their condition is usually chronic, responding poorly to treatment. It’s tragic that the form of romantic love that is most durable, most able to last, is the one where you <i class="calibre4">truly</i> have a mental disorder. But it’s worth noting that it’s only erotomania if the other person doesn’t reciprocate your feelings. If they do, you’re just the most romantic person ever.</p>
<p class="in_para">We don’t want erotomania. If we were going to pick a real mental disorder, it would be “folie à deux” (technically, shared psychotic disorder in the DSM-IV). This is when two people both lose it—together. You have to have achieved an intimate connection with the person to be susceptible, and separating the pair is an essential part of treating it. It’s underdiagnosed. Why? Because they rarely seek help. Yeah, they may believe some crazy things together, but the delusions are usually benign. A mild form of folie à deux should be our goal: a unique culture of two, with its own crazy but harmless beliefs and rituals. A silly but fulfilling story of the world and of their union that is special, idealized, and meaningful. One that doesn’t make much sense to anyone beyond the pair. But doesn’t need to. The most romantic relationships in my life have been like this, and I’m guessing you’ve experienced the same.</p>
<p class="in_para">So how do we get something closer to folie à deux? How do we fight the entropy and sustain the idealization? Most love stories are of little help. The trickiness of marriage begins where they end. And, as we saw, the fairy tales lead us astray here. Believing it’s supposed to be easy, magical, and passive is a big problem when you know it will take proactive work to resist entropy.</p>
<p class="in_para">The throes of romantic love are an addiction, but in some ways that’s easier. It really is out of your hands. Married love is a choice and one that will require diligent, consistent effort over time. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145" title="145"></span>Love is a verb. If you want to look good and be healthy, you have to consciously work on it. Love is no different.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what do we need to do? What we’re going to find is that entropy isn’t the biggest threat we face. A more dangerous enemy looms on the horizon. We can overcome it if we have the right tools. But we get so much lousy advice when it comes to love. Do the answers lie in logical reason or emotional feeling?</p>
<p class="in_para">Turns out this is a debate that has been going on for a long time, best illustrated, oddly enough, by the work of Edgar Allan Poe . . .</p>
