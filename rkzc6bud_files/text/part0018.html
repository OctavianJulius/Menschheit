<p class="ct_align">WARNING</p>
<p class="non_para">You’re going to hate me.</p>
<p class="in_para">As you’re already well aware, this is not your normal <i class="calibre4">feel-good-happy-happy-ignore-all-the-bad-stuff-tell-you-what-you-wanna-hear</i> relationship book. In following with that, you are not going to like everything you read in this section, and I just wanna warn you now.</p>
<p class="in_para">The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. As evolutionary psychologist and relationship researcher David Buss said, “Some of what I discovered about human mating is not nice.” And in your heart of hearts, you <i class="calibre4">know</i> that. The feeling of love is the best . . . but all the actual activities involved in loving, well, nobody denies that they often involve more than their share of unpleasantness.</p>
<p class="in_para">Most books in this genre just tell you what you want to hear. Then you do what they say, it doesn’t work—<i class="calibre4">and you blame yourself</i>. After a while you start to feel like maybe you’re broken. Like you’re the problem. And that’s not fair. (And now I’m left to clean up that mess and be the fall guy. That’s pretty unfair too.)</p>
<p class="in_para">The NIH, the FDA, and Eric’s mom all want it noted that you may have a truth seizure while reading this. I’m going to give you the best evidence we have. Some of it is gonna be like a whiskey sour, but without the whiskey. The answers may not all be to your liking at first, but we can’t fix what we don’t accurately understand.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116" title="116"></span>Take pity on me, dear reader. This is a sensitive issue that people have strong feelings about, and delivering the cold facts is undoubtedly an exercise in masochism.</p>
<p class="in_para">Rest assured, it’s not all bad. Far, far from it. And in the end, I do promise you “magic.” I promise you love and bliss—or at least the potential for it. But we have a challenging road ahead of us. So please finish the section before posting out-of-context quotes on Twitter, filling my inbox with <span class="make_smallcaps">ALL CAPS</span> hate mail, and calling for this book to be taken out of stores.</p>
<p class="in_para">There’s no Build-A-Bear store for a happy marriage, but I promise you the next closest thing. And the most honest thing. I am the crazy man who is going to attempt to make sense of love in less time than it takes to binge a Netflix show. Wish me luck. Here goes . . .</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">In the mid-1990s, Pfizer was in bad shape. The drugmaker had a storied history as the leading manufacturer of penicillin during World War II, but at the close of the twentieth century it had been eclipsed by competitors and badly needed a hit drug.</p>
<p class="in_para">Luckily, there was hope on the horizon. Pfizer’s UK lab had developed an angina medication, Sildenafil Citrate, which had the curious side effect of giving men erections. Yes, this would become Viagra. And at the time there wasn’t a single medication on the market approved to treat impotence. Not one. A drugmaker’s dream, right? There was only one problem.</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">Nobody thought Viagra was a good idea.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">As <i class="calibre4">Esquire</i> writer David Kushner recounts, “At the time, the idea of selling Viagra was considered crazy at best and immoral at worst.” The drug would become a household name and launch <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117" title="117"></span>the multibillion-dollar erectile dysfunction market, yet from day one, Pfizer’s conservative culture resisted moving the project forward. It would be the most uphill battle drug development had ever seen.</p>
<p class="in_para">The only reason the now-famous tumescent tonic ever made it to market was the strenuous effort of two unlikely heroes: Rooney Nelson, a young marketing guru from Jamaica, and “Dr. Sal,” a clinical pharmacist from Queens. They knew that erectile dysfunction hurt marriages, crippled self-esteem, and prevented otherwise healthy couples from having children. These two renegades bucked the system and overcame staggering opposition to bring that little blue pill to the world.</p>
<p class="in_para">The lab had shown that the drug worked, but would patients be okay with the side effects? Getting corporate approval for focus groups for a drug nobody supported would be difficult enough by itself. But Rooney and Sal needed approval for putting a patient in a room, <i class="calibre4">literally</i> showing him <i class="calibre4">Debbie Does Dallas</i> and encouraging him to masturbate. Somehow the two managed to get the company to assent. The most common side effect turned out to be four-hour erections . . . which most subjects thought was kinda cool, frankly. The first hurdle had been cleared. They had patients on their side.</p>
<p class="in_para">But internally Pfizer still saw this as “undignified medicine” and wouldn’t budge. The company argued that men would be too embarrassed to ask for it. No man wanted to look weak and say he was “impotent.” But Rooney knew this wasn’t a real problem, it was just a semantic one. And that’s how the term <i class="calibre4">erectile dysfunction</i> was born. No, that phrase isn’t a medical diagnosis that has been around forever. It’s a clinical-sounding euphemism born in the 1990s from marketing, not medicine.</p>
<p class="in_para">Half of Pfizer still felt the “trivial medication” would never <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118" title="118"></span>launch. But Rooney and Sal knew if they could just overcome internal Pfizer resistance, people would finally come to their senses and realize this was a license to print money . . . right? Wrong. Dr. Sal discovered they were going to meet at least as much external resistance as internal. Religious leaders of all stripes said they would protest. Conservative legislators did not want insurance companies subsidizing boners. It was a nightmare. The two felt that the world was against them.</p>
<p class="in_para">But Rooney had a plan. He realized they were going to have to do something stone-cold crazy, the equivalent of marketing heresy, to get this product out the door. He came to the conclusion that the best way to launch Viagra was, unbelievably, to talk about it as little as humanly possible. Yes, zillions had been spent on development and testing, and now they weren’t going to do anything in advance of FDA approval to promote it. It was insane, but it was the only way to avoid the resistance. And it worked.</p>
<p class="in_para">In March 1998 Viagra received FDA approval. And with that, momentum was finally on their side. All they had to do was talk to Pfizer’s sales team about how to pitch the drug . . . but the salespeople didn’t want to do it. They said they felt awkward talking with doctors about penises. And that’s how Rooney ended up at a sales conference, leading groups of people to say “erection” out loud five times to make them comfortable with it: <i class="calibre4">Erection! Erection! Erection! Erection! Erection!</i></p>
<p class="in_para">As launch day approached, almost everyone thought Pfizer would be a laughingstock. But you already know how this story ends. Viagra was an unprecedented success, a cultural phenomenon, and a comedic gift to late-night talk show hosts everywhere. Soon pharmacists said that they were filling ten thousand prescriptions a day. It outdid the release of Prozac. Within days, Pfizer’s share price doubled.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119" title="119"></span>The medication may have been blue, but it ended up being more like Rudolph’s red nose: nobody liked it until it saved them all. The drug that no one believed in became the drug everyone wanted.</p>
<p class="in_para">When it comes to sex, love, and marriage, everything is complicated and nothing is obvious, simple, or easy. The little blue pill certainly conquered all, but can love? On average, Viagra lasts two hours. How long does love last?</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">Around 38 <span class="make_smallcaps">B</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">C</span>. the Roman poet Virgil wrote, “omnia vincit amor,” or “love conquers all.” You can find similar wording in the Bible. 1 Corinthians 13:7 reads, “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” And we still hear versions of the maxim to this day in songs and movies and at wedding ceremonies. But is it true? Does love really conquer all?</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">Of course not.</i> (So far, this is looking to be a very short chapter.) I’m all for poetic license, but have you <i class="calibre4">seen</i> any divorce statistics lately? I’ll save you the Google search: roughly 40 percent of US marriages end in divorce. The proverbial seven-year-itch is more like four; divorce is most common about four years after the wedding. And that stat is true around the world. (In fact, anthropologist Helen Fisher notes that one in ten US women have been married three or more times by the time they turn forty.)</p>
<p class="in_para">I’m not trying to be a downer here, but if cars crashed 40 percent of the time you drove them and your marketing slogan was “Honda Conquers All,” you’d have a class action lawsuit on your hands. Just like Pfizer initially got it wrong with Viagra, we have a lot of myths and misunderstandings about love. For one thing, it didn’t originate with courtly love in the Middle Ages. Romantic love has been around forever. The earliest love poetry dates back <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" title="120"></span>over 3,500 years in Egypt. And love is universal. Of 168 cultures studied by anthropologists, 90 percent recognize it, and in the other 10 percent there weren’t enough data to confirm it.</p>
<p class="in_para">The experience of love is largely consistent no matter which country, age, gender, orientation, or ethnic group you study. It’s almost certainly innate, and we know this because throughout history many cultures (including the Shakers, Mormons, and East Germans) attempted to suppress romantic love—and all failed spectacularly.</p>
<p class="in_para">That said, the details can certainly vary. In a Jacksonville, Florida, survey, 60 percent of people said their spouse was their best friend. You know how many said the same thing in Mexico City? Zero. And cultures that romantically kiss are actually in the minority: only 46 percent of the 168 studied smooch. And love is not always associated with the heart. In West Africa the seat of love is the nose, and for Trobriand islanders it’s the intestines. (This calls for some serious reinterpretation of sneezing and indigestion metaphors.)</p>
<p class="in_para">The form that long-term love usually takes for us is marriage, and that leads us to the Big Kahuna of myths we need to contend with. We’ve all read a thousand articles that say marriage makes you healthier and happier. Umm, no. Many of these studies merely survey married people and single people, compare the happiness levels, find that the married people are doing better, and crow, “See? Marriage makes you healthy and happy.” But that’s committing an error called “survivor bias.” If you want to determine if <i class="calibre4">getting</i> married makes you happier, you need to include separated, divorced, and widowed people in with the <i class="calibre4">currently</i> married, not with the unmarried. Otherwise, it’s equivalent to studying only blockbuster movie stars and saying, “Becoming an actor is obviously an excellent career choice.”</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121" title="121"></span>When you examine the set of all people who have ever walked down the aisle versus people who never have, the health and happiness results are very different. Simply put: <i class="calibre4">marriage doesn’t make you healthy and happy; a good marriage makes you healthy and happy</i>. And a bad marriage, even one in the past, can have very (or very very very) negative effects.</p>
<p class="in_para">What effects does marriage have on health? Well, if you’re a winner on the connubial game show, the positives are plentiful. Metrics for heart attacks, cancer, dementia, illness, blood pressure, or even straight-up likelihood of dying all improve. (Today’s married men enjoy an average seven-year boost in life expectancy.) But here’s where I need to include that nasty word <i class="calibre4">however</i>. If you’re unhappily married, your health is likely to be notably worse than if you never got hitched at all. A bad marriage makes you 35 percent more likely to fall ill and lops four years off your life. A study of almost nine thousand people found divorced and widowed people had 20 percent more health problems (including heart disease and cancer). And most surprisingly, some of those effects never went away, even if they remarried. Folks on marriage number two had 12 percent more serious health issues than those who never split up, and divorced women were 60 percent more likely to have cardiovascular disease, even if they took another walk down the aisle.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what about happiness? If you’ve got a good marriage, getting hitched definitely provides a boost. A 2010 study from Australia even said previous research probably <i class="calibre4">underestimated</i> just how happy people in happy marriages are. But the flip side is even more damning than you may have guessed. A study of the medical records of five thousand patients analyzed the most stressful life events people deal with. Divorce came in at #2. (Death of a spouse was number one.) Divorce even beat <i class="calibre4">going to prison</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122" title="122"></span>Hold on, it gets worse. Human beings are pretty resilient. With almost all bad things that happen, your happiness levels eventually return to baseline. But not with divorce. An eighteen-year study of thirty thousand people showed that after a marriage goes splitsville, levels of subjective well-being rebound—but not completely. It seems divorce puts a permanent dent in your happiness. And when you look at everyone across the marital spectrum, nobody is more despondent than the unhappily married. If you’re going to be lonely, it’s better to do it alone.</p>
<p class="in_para">So marriage is no guarantee of health or happiness; it’s more like gambling: big wins or big losses. And, extending the gambling analogy, the odds are not fifty-fifty. As <i class="calibre4">New York Times</i> columnist David Brooks wrote, “In the United States, nearly 40 percent of marriages end in divorce. Another 10 or 15 percent of couples separate and do not divorce, and another 7 percent or so stay together but are chronically unhappy.” No matter how you slice it, this is no guarantee. It’s a minority of people who are happily married and stay that way.</p>
<p class="in_para">What gives? This is definitely not what society tells us about love and marriage. And how did we get to this place of extremes where marriage either makes you blissfully happy or utterly destroys your life? Was it always like this?</p>
<p class="in_para">Nope. Marriage <i class="calibre4">did</i> once conquer all . . . but back then it had nothing to do with love. In fact, historically speaking, you could say “love ruined marriage.” Or “love overcame marriage.” As historian Stephanie Coontz notes, for most of recorded history the theme song of marriage could have been Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got to Do with It?” (Author’s note: I do not recommend playing that song, or U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” at your wedding.)</p>
<p class="in_para">For the vast majority of recorded history, marriage had more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123" title="123"></span>to do with economics than love. This wasn’t part of some evil plan; it was due to the fact that life was really frickin’ hard. “Love marriages” were not a realistic option. The model was more like the help-me-not-die marriage. Life was often nasty, brutish, and short. You couldn’t make it on your own. Personal fulfillment took a back seat to putting food in your mouth and fighting off brigands. Coontz notes that marriage did what governments and markets do today. It was social security, unemployment insurance, and Medicare before there was such a thing. Just like your career today might be more about paying the bills and have little to do with what you’re passionate about, back then who you married was about paying the bills and had little to do with <i class="calibre4">who</i> you were passionate about. Marriage was a lot more like workmates than soulmates.</p>
<p class="in_para">For the rich, the history of marriage is like an MBA class in mergers and acquisitions. It was less about finding the right spouse and more about getting the right in-laws. Yes, today you complain about in-laws, but back then it was actually the reason you married. Think about it: you don’t need matrimony to fall in love or make babies, but you <i class="calibre4">do</i> need it to forge long-term alliances with powerful families. In fact, in-laws were such a priority that in some countries like China you even saw “ghost marriages.” Yes, marrying a dead person. (Upside: fewer arguments.) In the Bella Coola society of the Pacific Northwest, sometimes the competition to get the right in-laws was so intense that people would get married to another family’s dog. Yes, really.</p>
<p class="in_para">Of course, married people back then did fall in love . . . it just wasn’t usually with their spouse. After all, that’s what affairs were for. As Alexandre Dumas quipped, “The bonds of wedlock are so heavy that it takes two to carry them, sometimes three.” Loving your spouse was often regarded as impossible, immoral, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124" title="124"></span>stupid. The great Stoic philosopher Seneca said, “Nothing is more impure than to love one’s wife as if she were a mistress.” And what did Roman philosophers call someone in the passionate throes of love with his wife? “An adulterer.”</p>
<p class="in_para">More important, Coontz notes that love within marriage was seen as a threat to the social order. Life was too difficult for individual happiness to be very high on the totem pole. You had to put your responsibility to family, state, religion, or community before personal fulfillment. Marriage was too important an economic and political institution to be left up to the whims of love. <i class="calibre4">Passion? You better keep a lid on that stuff. It gets in the way. We got a good thing here; you wanna turn it into an episode of Jerry Springer?</i> In polygamous cultures it was acceptable to love your wife—but save it for wife number two or three, okay? We have a society to run here. Thanks.</p>
<p class="in_para">But then things changed. The 1700s arrived and you had the Enlightenment era. People started talking about these wild new things called “human rights.” It wasn’t that everybody suddenly wised up or became nice; again, it was economics. Free markets. People were making more coin, and you could survive on your own. Individualism became a realistic option, so by the 1800s many people were marrying for love . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">And, almost immediately, things kinda went to hell. Yes, individuals gained more choice and the wonderful possibility of love and happiness, but as for conquering all, marriage got a lot less stable. The same thing that increased people’s satisfaction with marriage made it fragile. They had to create the word <i class="calibre4">dating</i> in the 1890s because the concept didn’t even exist before then. The formerly rock-solid institution of marriage was under siege. And by the early twentieth century the wheels were about to pop off. There was a breathtaking level of change going on: electricity, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125" title="125"></span>cars, trains, antibiotics. Between 1880 and 1920 the US divorce rate doubled.</p>
<p class="in_para">But then World War II happened. In its wake, life in the United States got pretty good economically, and so marriage was pretty good. Employment went up and divorce rates dropped. And in the 1950s you had the apex of what many today still consider the “traditional” marriage: the nuclear family. Think <i class="calibre4">Donna Reed</i>, <i class="calibre4">Leave it to Beaver</i>, and <i class="calibre4">Father Knows Best</i>. Mom, Dad, 2.4 kids, and a dog. Everything was swell. But, ironically, this era that many today still consider the platonic form of marriage was actually just a blip. Far from the rule, historians Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg call it “the great exception.” And it sure didn’t last long.</p>
<p class="in_para">By the 1970s that “traditional” marriage was already coming apart. States passed no-fault divorce. For the first time, just being unhappy was a legally acceptable reason to end your marriage. By 1980 the US divorce rate hit 50 percent. The centuries-long shift was nearly complete. The unmarried were no longer seen as broken or immoral. The number of cohabiting couples skyrocketed. Pregnancy no longer meant that you needed to get married. And in 2015 the Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage. Love had triumphed.</p>
<p class="in_para">Heck, it not only won, but for the first time in history it was <i class="calibre4">essential</i>. And we forget just how new a concept that is. Daniel Hruschka notes that in the 1960s, a third of men and three-quarters of women didn’t think love was essential before getting married. By the 1990s, 86 percent of men and 91 percent of women said they wouldn’t marry unless they were in love. Over the centuries, the song went from Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got to Do with It?” to the Beatles’ “All You Need Is Love.”</p>
<p class="in_para">But that doesn’t mean there’s no downside to all this freedom. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126" title="126"></span>Northwestern professor Eli Finkel calls our modern paradigm “the self-expressive marriage.” The definition of marriage is up to you . . . which is kinda terrifying. Do you know <i class="calibre4">exactly</i> what you want? You better. Marriage is no longer defined by church, government, family, or society. It’s a DIY kit. Instruction manual sold separately. Marriages of the past were definitely unfair and unequal in many ways, but the rules were clear. Today we’re confused.</p>
<p class="in_para">And if that wasn’t difficult enough, our expectations for marriage have gone through the roof. We still want many things marriage provided in the past, but now we think wedlock should fulfill all our dreams, bring out our best selves, and offer continuous growth. The Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” is not on the playlist. We don’t just divorce because we’re unhappy but because we could be <i class="calibre4">even happier</i>. Finkel says that before, you had to justify leaving your spouse; now, you have to justify staying. And while our expectations of marriage have gone up, our ability to meet them has gone down. Couples are working longer hours and spending less time together. Between 1975 and 2003 the amount of time spouses spent together on weekdays plunged by 30 percent if they didn’t have kids and 40 percent if they did.</p>
<p class="in_para">And at the same time, marriage has crowded out other relationships that might reduce its burden. Research by Robin Dunbar at Oxford shows that falling in love costs you two close friends. And Finkel points out that in 1975 Americans spent two hours every weekend day with friends or relatives. By 2003 that number had dropped 40 percent. Meanwhile, between 1980 and 2000 the degree to which a happy marriage predicted personal happiness almost doubled. Marriage isn’t one of your relationships, it’s the relationship. We’re experiencing the spousification of life.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127" title="127"></span>With each of the past few decades, marriage stability has been increasing, and divorce rates are down. Problem is, that’s mostly because fewer people are getting married at all. Marriage rates are down globally since the 1970s, and they’re currently at historic lows for the United States. NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg writes, “For the first time in history, the typical American now spends more years single than married.” Marriage has gone from being a cornerstone to a capstone. It used to be something you did while young and on the path to adulthood. Now its demands seem so onerous that people want to make sure they have all their ducks in a row before attempting it—if they choose to walk down the aisle at all.</p>
<p class="in_para">No, yelling at me won’t make any of this less true. I understand if you’re a bit frustrated now that I’ve spent pages sowing depressing marriage factoids across the land like some sort of statistical Johnny Appleseed. I put that warning at the beginning of the chapter for a reason. If you’re about to write a one-star Amazon review, stand down. No need to go to Defcon 1. I do have good news. Very good news, in fact. Yes, the average marriage has been getting worse year after year without much hope, but there’s something you should know about the <i class="calibre4">best</i> marriages right now . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">They are better than any in the history of humanity. Period.</p>
<p class="in_para">Finkel confirms it: “The best marriages today are better than the best marriages of earlier eras; indeed, they are the best marriages that the world has ever known.” Divorce may put a permanent dent in your happiness and the average marriage may be pretty disappointing, but if you do this married thing right, your marriage will be happier than anybody’s at any time ever. You will rule. So it’s not doom and gloom for everyone—it’s winner takes all. And that’s why Finkel calls wedlock in our era “the all or nothing marriage.”</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128" title="128"></span>I’m sorry if I demolished your fairy-tale visions. But fairy tales don’t help. A 2011 Marist poll concluded 73 percent of Americans believe in soulmates, and a 2000 study found that 78 percent of people’s vision of love contain fairy-tale elements. But what researchers also realized was that people who believe in those things actually experience more disillusionment and angst in their marriages than those who were more grounded. Why?</p>
<p class="in_para">Fairy tales are passive. And these days happy marriages take proactive work. But if you do the work, you can have one of those greatest-marriages-ever. To quote Finkel, “Relative to marriages in earlier eras, marriages today require much greater dedication and nurturance, a change that has placed an ever-larger proportion of marriages at risk of stagnation and dissolution. But spouses who invest the requisite time and energy in the relationship can achieve a level of conjugal fulfillment that would have been out of reach in earlier eras.”</p>
<p class="in_para">So if you’re struggling at love these days, you’re not crazy and you’re not alone and it’s not necessarily your fault. We now know love, as a general rule, doesn’t conquer all. But <i class="calibre4">your</i> love can if you do it right. So we’re going to tweak the maxim. Instead of “Does love conquer all?” we’re going to solve the mystery of “How can we make sure <i class="calibre4">your</i> love conquers all?”</p>
<p class="in_para">And we’ll start down the road to solving that puzzle by looking at the greatest lover who ever lived . . .</p>
