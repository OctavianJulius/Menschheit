<h2 class="chap_head" id="calibre_pb_3">2. REMIND</h2>
<p class="in_paral">Okay, I cheated. This is not really “reminding.” I needed an R word. What we’re really doing here is going deeper and learning more about your partner to build intimacy. A 2001 study found couples who really open up to each other are nearly two-thirds more likely to say they have a happy union. Our buddy Casanova once said, “Love is three-quarters curiosity.” And Gottman’s research backs him up. The happiest couples understand a lot about their partners. He calls this deep knowledge a “love map.” Knowing how they like their coffee, the little worries that bother them, what their biggest hopes and dreams are. This info not only increases intimacy but also reduces conflict by what Gottman calls “preemptive repair.” We all have concerns and sensitivities, rational or not, and when you’re aware of those, you can avoid them before they become an issue.</p>
<p class="in_paral"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" title="167"></span>So look up from your smartphone and get to know your partner better. Use those questions Arthur Aron created that I mentioned in <a href="part0007.html#ch2" class="calibre1">chapter 2</a>. (You can download a PDF of the questions here: https://www.bakadesuyo.com/aron.) Not only did answering those questions build friendship, but the very first pair of research assistants who answered them together ended up getting married.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Knowing how they like their coffee is good, but the real value here is in understanding the personal, idiosyncratic meanings they have of things. What does love mean to them? Marriage? Happiness? Dig for their unique perspective on things like what “being fulfilled” entails. When you know that your partner sees the completion of household chores as an important expression of caring, then it’s not a mystery why they’re getting upset—and you can do something about it.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Dan Wile once wrote, “Choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems.” But when you take the time to get to know somebody, you can see the emotional reasons why things don’t mean to them what they might mean to you. That understanding can change “difficult problems” into “lovable quirks.” When you know they leave the lights on in the bathroom sometimes because of a childhood fear of the dark, the lazy idiot becomes a sympathetic human with acceptable foibles.</p>
<p class="in_paral">And, more important, Gottman says that understanding people’s idiosyncratic meanings is how you overcome those perpetual problems—the intractable 69 percent. What does gridlock on an issue mean? It means this is tied to something important to them. Values. The same thing causing you all that grief can be a door to a deep insight into your partner. If you know what something really means to them, maybe you can find something that honors both of your visions of life. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168" title="168"></span>Or maybe you can at least respect each other’s position instead of the NSO path to thinking they’re trying to sabotage your happiness. Like Gottman said, dealing with those perpetual problems is about regulation, not resolution. And that works a lot better when you’re honestly able to tell them “I don’t agree, but I see why you feel that way.”</p>
<p class="in_paral">Expanding on meaning, talking about dreams and values may sound saccharine, but it’s crucial. You’re on a journey together, so it’s kinda important that you both wanna head in the same direction, eh? What’s their ideal life? Their ideal self? These are big questions, but if you start answering them, the smaller stuff starts falling into place and that crazy person you live with can start to make sense. All couples argue about money. Why? Because money is all about values. It’s a quantification of what’s important to you. Get closer to an understanding of their values, and the money problem magically gets easier to deal with.</p>
<p class="in_paral">You don’t want to just “get along.” God, how low a standard is that? Do all the above right and you get on the path to shared meaning. That’s the first step toward the good side of “the Tolstoy principle”: your unique culture of two. Folie à deux. To have your own secret language. An emotional shorthand. Silly stuff infused with rich personal meaning. Those inside jokes, things you say that are crazy to everyone else but mean so much to the two of you. Building your own little religion. This is when couples truly can’t bear to be apart, because they have a shared identity, a shared story, because the other person is inextricably a part of their future progress, future goals, and how they will become their ideal self.</p>
<p class="in_paral">And that unique culture should be supported by unique rituals. A big part of making this special culture of two and cementing a shared identity is infusing the day-to-day with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169" title="169"></span>that special meaning. These aren’t the big, exciting moments of expansion; they’re the little things. Mealtimes, bedtime, vacations, date night, partings, reunitings, scheduled snuggling appointments, and celebrations are all perfect moments for having a special, weird something that sets your love apart.</p>
<p class="in_paral">A good concrete one to start with? At the end of the workday when you reunite, you each take a turn sharing the good news of the day. And both of you support and celebrate what the other says. Repeated studies have shown this can boost happiness and relationship satisfaction. UCSB professor Shelly Gable has found that how couples celebrate can actually be more important than how you fight. Again, like Gottman said, in many cases, if you increase the positive, the negative doesn’t matter quite as much.</p>
<p class="in_para_ts">But what about when change is necessary?</p>
