<section title="Chapter 9" epub:type="bodymatter">
<h2 class="chap_num" id="ch9"><span class="right_" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95" title="95"></span><a href="part0003.html#rch9" class="calibre3">9</a></h2>
<p class="non_para">His mother had always said that people were complex. But Danny didn’t necessarily believe her, and it certainly didn’t prepare him for what happened that night in 1941.</p>
<p class="in_para">The Nazis had occupied France in 1940 and instituted a curfew of 6 <span class="make_smallcaps">P</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">M</span>. But this night seven-year-old Danny had stayed too late at a friend’s house. Briskly walking home, scared, he turned his sweater inside out. He wanted to conceal the yellow Star of David on it that indicated he was Jewish.</p>
<p class="in_para">Luckily, the streets were empty. It seemed safe. He was almost home. But then he saw a man. A German soldier. And not just any German soldier. This man wore the black uniform of the SS, the type Danny had been told to fear more than any other. And when you’re seven, you take that advice to heart.</p>
<p class="in_para">But he was almost home. Maybe he could hide, maybe he wouldn’t be seen . . . Then the two made eye contact. Total “deer in the headlights” moment. It was after curfew. He was Jewish. And he was <i class="calibre4">hiding it</i>. This. Was. Not. Good.</p>
<p class="in_para">The SS officer beckoned him. A lump the size of a planet formed in Danny’s throat as he obeyed. He just hoped the soldier would not notice the sweater. Danny closed the distance. And that’s when the Nazi moved, sharply, grabbing him . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">In a hug. A hug so deep and so firm he lifted the seven-year-old off the ground. At first, Danny didn’t even react to it, barely noticed it, his brain only thinking, “Don’t notice the star, don’t notice the star” on repeat.</p>
<p class="in_para">The Nazi put him down and began speaking emotionally in German. Were those tears in his eyes? From his wallet he took <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96" title="96"></span>out a picture of a young boy and showed it to Danny. The message was obvious: the epitome of evil had a son Danny’s age. And missed him desperately.</p>
<p class="in_para">The Nazi gave Danny some money and smiled at him. And then they went their separate ways.</p>
<p class="in_para">This man who was capable of doing the most horrible things, who represents evil better than anything else we know today, still had love compartmentalized inside him. And seeing Danny, to be reminded of his own son, brought that out. Danny’s mother had been right: people were endlessly complex.</p>
<p class="in_para">That brief, terrifying lesson about the complexity of human nature would shape the rest of Danny’s life. He would go on to get a PhD in psychology. He would focus on the seeming irrationality of human behavior. He would become a professor at Princeton University. And Daniel Kahneman would tell that story of the night with the Nazi in the statement they have you write when you’re awarded a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p class="in_para">There’s a secret hidden in the kindness that happened that night. Something neither of them understood at the time, that science has only recently uncovered: that there may be a way to bring out the good in “bad” people.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">The data show, on average, for every ten friends you gain, you’ll also get a new enemy. Oh, and the old expression “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” isn’t true. Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler found that the jerks in your life have their own jerks, and you’d find their jerks to be pretty jerky as well. But unless you’re Batman talking about the Joker, an enemy generally isn’t the most problematic person in your life. So who is?</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97" title="97"></span>“Frenemies” are often worse than enemies. Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychology professor at BYU, found that frenemies (the formal designation is “ambivalent relationships”) increase anxiety and drive your blood pressure through the roof—even more than true enemies do. Why are frenemies more stressful than enemies? It’s the unpredictability. You know what to expect from enemies and supportive friends—but with those ambivalent ones you’re always on edge. And that’s the reason Holt-Lunstad found that the number of frenemies correlated with depression and heart disease over time. But does that really make frenemies worse than enemies? Yeah, because, believe it or not, ambivalent friends make up <i class="calibre4">half</i> our relationships. And studies find that we don’t see them any less often than supportive friends.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now sometimes frenemies are merely people we don’t “click” with, but other times it’s because they’re narcissists. As physicist Bernard Bailey quipped, “When they discover the center of the universe, a lot of people will be disappointed to discover they are not it.” What the heck is wrong with these people? Well, it actually fits surprisingly well into our Aristotelian paradigm. Narcissists don’t include others in their “self,” at least not much or often. Narcissism is when you stop trying to soothe your insecurities by relying on people and instead turn to an imaginary self where you are superior.</p>
<p class="in_para">We all have fantasy lives where we’re rich and awesome and admired. That’s human. And we all have dreams of our enemies being crushed beneath our boots, humiliated in the town square, and tortured mercilessly until . . . Okay, maybe that’s just me. As Dr. Craig Malkin points out, the distinction is, we <i class="calibre4">enjoy</i> our dreams—but narcissists are <i class="calibre4">addicted</i> to their dreams. Most of us find strength in others; they find it only in themselves. There isn’t “another self.” And that lack of empathy is central to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98" title="98"></span>disorder. For narcissists, “getting ahead is more important than getting along.” And as for “a friend in need”? To a narcissist, a friend in need is simply a weak person.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what’s the best way to deal with a narcissist? The answer is simple: don’t. Say “<span class="make_smallcaps">MEEP</span>-<span class="make_smallcaps">MEEP</span>” and sprint away Road Runner–style as fast as you can. The first-line recommendation of professionals is consistent; we just usually don’t want to do it. But what if “no contact” isn’t an option? Or you really believe this frenemy can be redeemed?</p>
<p class="in_para">If they have full-blown NPD (narcissistic personality disorder), forget it. I’d sooner tell you to do your own appendectomy than try and change a clinical narcissist. Guess how well therapy works on them? Often a grand total of not at all. They frequently have “negative treatment outcome”—they get worse. It’s well documented that “countertransference” is a big problem in therapy with narcissists. Translation: <i class="calibre4">they even manipulate the professionals who try to treat them</i>. And what you’ll have to do to contend with them will damage you for other relationships.</p>
<p class="in_para">But if they’re subclinical, there’s a shot. We’re going to use what are called “empathy prompts.” Narcissists have trouble with empathy, but the research shows it’s not because they have <i class="calibre4">zero</i> empathy; it’s more like their empathy muscle is weak. More than a dozen studies show it’s possible to activate that weak muscle in lower-level narcissists and, with time, strengthen it. But it’s important to remember here that what we’re doing is emotional, not cognitive. Wagging a finger at a narcissist, telling them what they did wrong and what you want is just instructing them how to more effectively manipulate you. The goal is to emotionally scooch yourself into their identity as “another self.” This involves critical <i class="calibre4">feeling</i>, not critical thinking.</p>
<p class="in_para">What’s great is that empathy prompts are both litmus test and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99" title="99"></span>treatment. If the narcissist doesn’t respond, they’re probably past the clinical threshold. (The next step involves garlic and a stake through the heart.) But if they are affected, you can help them improve.</p>
<p class="in_para">So how do we bring out the best in “bad” people? We’ll attack from three angles.</p>
