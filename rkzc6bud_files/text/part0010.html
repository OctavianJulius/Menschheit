<p class="non_para">In 2007 an astronomer at the Parkes radio telescope in Australia was reviewing archival data and noticed something so incredible that people said it might prove the existence of alien life.</p>
<p class="in_para">It wasn’t surprising that it had been overlooked when it originally happened back in 2001. The burst of radio waves had lasted just five milliseconds. (You can’t even read the word <i class="calibre4">milliseconds</i> in five milliseconds.) The source was unknown, and these radio waves traveled three billion light-years to get here. But NASA would confirm that in those mere five milliseconds it generated <i class="calibre4">as much energy as five hundred million suns</i>. (I’d love to use a metaphor to convey the magnitude of that number, but my puny brain can’t wrap my head around five hundred million suns, so we’re gonna go with “double-extra-super powerful.”)</p>
<p class="in_para">It was dubbed a “fast radio burst.” It was, as those of us knowledgeable in the field like to say, double-extra-super powerful. Seems like a stretch that this proves Klingons exist . . . except that when NASA recently discussed what it would take to get to Mars in three days, the scientists suggested it would require a light sail photonic propulsion system that, um, sounds like it would produce a burst just like this. And much later when two scientists ran the numbers on FRBs, they said, “the optimal frequency for powering the light sail is shown to be similar to the detected FRB frequencies.” And the two scientists weren’t crackpots on YouTube wearing tinfoil hats; they were Avi Loeb and Manasvi Lingam from Harvard’s Astrophysics Department.</p>
<p class="in_para">So “aliens” wasn’t as crazy as it might sound. But there was only one of these things, so at first the “Lorimer Burst” was chalked <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55" title="55"></span>up to an error, some sort of radio telescope hiccup. But soon they found more. A lot more.</p>
<p class="in_para">In 2010, astrophysicist Sarah Burke-Spolaor uncovered records of sixteen similar bursts that occurred back in 1998. (If this was alien communication, we’re that friend who is absolutely horrible about responding to texts.) But even more interesting was that these sixteen signals were <i class="calibre4">different</i>. In many ways they seemed like FRBs, but they were actually what would come to be known as “perytons.” Perytons are local. They’re not from billions of light-years away; they’re generated from something right here on Earth.</p>
<p class="in_para">One could speculate that perytons meant that the aliens had reached Earth. If FRBs were messages from extraterrestrials to our planet, maybe perytons were ET phoning home. But the most popular theory was that perytons just proved this was all bunk. Perytons were probably due to lightning, or even more likely, some sort of human-made interference. And some scientists argued that FRBs were probably just perytons too. The debate raged for years.</p>
<p class="in_para">But then on May 14, 2014, at the Parkes telescope they detected an FRB <i class="calibre4">live</i>, in real time. They confirmed it had originated at least 5.5 billion light-years away. Perytons might be local interference, but this confirmed that FRBs were real. The whole field of astronomy was rocked by the news.</p>
<p class="in_para">Solving the FRB issue would be near impossible because they originated so far away. But perytons are local. This was potentially solvable. And this could be one of the most momentous discoveries humankind would ever make. And what do we do with intellectually rich, incredibly challenging problems that could change the course of history?</p>
<p class="in_para">Yup, that’s right: we dump them on the intern.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56" title="56"></span>Enter our plucky hero: Emily Petroff. She was twenty-five. Hadn’t even completed her astrophysics PhD yet. And she was put in charge of solving one of the biggest mysteries in astronomy. No real help. No big financial grants. Good luck, kid . . . But Emily was fascinated by FRBs and perytons and was prepared to go further than anyone else.</p>
<p class="in_para">And she quickly realized just how hard finding the cause of the mysterious energy source was going to be. Astrophysicists are not dummies. They don’t want interference to cause grief, so telescope sites are in the middle of nowhere in radio quiet zones. Cellphones are banned. Faraday cages are used to shield equipment from electromagnetic waves. What the heck could be causing it?</p>
<p class="in_para">And there was another, even more curious issue: the perytons detected at Parkes had been at two frequencies, 2.5 ghz and 1.4 ghz. The first was common, but the second was different. Nothing scientists were aware of transmitted at 1.4 ghz. It might <i class="calibre4">actually</i> be aliens. And if these were perytons, that meant aliens could be right here among us. Since 1998.</p>
<p class="in_para">But Emily wasn’t buying the aliens story, so she spent months evaluating data from the telescope . . . which turned out to be a dead end. Refusing to give up, Emily installed an interference monitor on the telescope to detect frequencies getting in the way. Again, nothing.</p>
<p class="in_para">Finally, in January 2015, she caught a break. The telescope detected three new perytons—<i class="calibre4">in a single week</i>. This was not random. Could it be an attempt at communication from the extraterrestrial source here on Earth? Every one of the perytons had two signals, one at 2.5 ghz and another at the mysterious 1.4 ghz. Emily was able to compare data from her new interference monitor to results from the ATCA observatory nearby. It didn’t pick up the 2.5 ghz, but she did. This clinched it: the perytons were not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57" title="57"></span>coming from outer space. Whatever was producing this unknown frequency was close to the telescope. It was here. On Earth.</p>
<p class="in_para">And the timing of the perytons wasn’t random. They all happened during the workday. It finally clicked. They all had something in common. One supremely profound thing that every human alive and every human who has ever lived sees as vital . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Lunch. The Parkes perytons were all happening at lunchtime. So what operates at 2.5 ghz? Emily had an idea. She sprinted downstairs. And there was our alien: the microwave in the telescope break room. Most radio telescope sites ban microwaves. The interference monitor data confirmed that the telescope had been pointed toward the break room every time a peryton had been detected.</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">Yes, the biggest mystery in astronomy wasn’t caused by aliens; it was caused by scientists heating up burritos.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">But this didn’t solve everything. Yes, Hot Pockets were producing the 2.5 ghz signal, not Wookies. But there were <i class="calibre4">two</i> frequencies. What about the 1.4 ghz? Nothing the scientists worked with released a 1.4 ghz signal. The alien theory could not be ruled out.</p>
<p class="in_para">But Emily knew that where there’s human error, there’s probably <i class="calibre4">more</i> human error. True, nothing they knew of <i class="calibre4">normally</i> released a 1.4 ghz burst. And microwaves usually operate at 2.5 ghz . . . So our ever-resourceful hero tried a quick experiment: if she turned on the microwave and opened the door before it had finished cooking, guess what happened? The microwave’s magnetron released a quick 1.4 ghz emission alongside the 2.5 ghz.</p>
<p class="in_para">So, correction: <i class="calibre4">the biggest mystery in astronomy wasn’t caused by aliens; it was caused by</i> impatient <i class="calibre4">scientists heating up burritos.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">Emily knew it wasn’t extraterrestrials. And the majority of reputable scientists never took the alien theory seriously. But it didn’t matter. The alien story was irresistible. The media had gone nuts. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58" title="58"></span>People were dying to know more—not about science—but about the possibility of extraterrestrials.</p>
<p class="in_para">Our brains love simple, sexy stories like aliens. (Our brains are also impatient to reheat pizza.) And whether we’re talking about perytons and aliens or trying to read the minds of other Earth dwellers, it’s all too easy to misinterpret signals and come up with fantastical interpretations that are clean, simple, sexy . . . and wrong.</p>
<p class="in_para">Please think of Emily Petroff next time you reheat your leftovers. (And slice them up with Occam’s razor while you’re at it.) The great peryton mystery was solved . . . however, that doesn’t mean everything was answered. FRBs still remain unexplained. Perhaps aliens are out there in a faraway galaxy, impatient to get their own Hot Pockets out of the microwave?</p>
<p class="in_para">Or maybe that’s yet another sexy, inaccurate story I’m telling myself.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">So can you “judge a book by its cover”? Let’s review the big takeaways.</p>
<p class="in_para">Though we’re decent with first impressions, lie detection is a coin toss, and we’re horrible at the passive reading of people’s thoughts and feelings (I know a horse that’s better at it than we are). Even worse, our initial mistakes tend to stick in our minds. We are often our own worst enemy. Confirmation bias causes us to remember hits and forget the misses, blinding us to what might correct our story and make it more accurate.</p>
<p class="in_para">While passive reading is often inaccurate, we can improve by getting motivated and actively engaging people. But it’s a mistake to focus too much on improving your ability. Whether <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59" title="59"></span>you’re trying to decipher their personality or detect lies, the biggest gains in accuracy are achieved by getting them to increase the signals they’re sending. You can’t make yourself much better at detecting lies, but you can leverage solid methods like cognitive load and strategic use of evidence to make people so bad at telling them that it’ll be much easier to notice. (And don’t mistake microwaving a Hot Pocket for alien contact.)</p>
<p class="in_para">All of this naturally leads us to a question: <i class="calibre4">Why are we bad at reading others?</i> You’d think this would be a useful skill. Should we launch a class action suit against Mother Nature? Does the human brain need a factory recall? Why is a social species so flawed at something seemingly so valuable?</p>
<p class="in_para">One reason is our poor accuracy may not be a flaw at all. Being too accurate when reading people can be a nightmare. We all have fleeting negative feelings about our partners, friends, and relationships. That’s normal. But if you noticed every negative thought anyone had about you, it would give your anxieties anxieties. The vast majority of the time, being unaware of these momentary issues is preferable. And that’s exactly what studies have found. Empathic accuracy isn’t a universal good; it’s a double-edged sword. A study by Simpson, Ickes, and Ortina found that empathic accuracy is a positive if it doesn’t uncover information threatening to the relationship. But if it does, it’s a negative. In fact, if there’s negative information to be gleaned, <i class="calibre4">avoiding</i> accuracy improved relationship stability.</p>
<p class="in_para">As one team of psychologists put it: “People often want to learn how to improve the accuracy of their social judgments . . . but it is unclear if seeing social reality is a healthy goal.” Would you feel comfortable if others could detect every thought <i class="calibre4">you</i> had when you’re in a foul mood? At times, you second-guess your relationships. It’s natural and healthy, but knowing about those moments <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60" title="60"></span>could hurt others. Let’s not forget the curse of HSAM. Too much negative info or too perfect a memory just doesn’t make for good relationships. We need to round off the edges, to be able to give the benefit of the doubt, to miss something that’s true but unrepresentative. So maybe Mother Nature decided on a healthy compromise: we’re pretty good at reading people when sufficiently motivated and engaged—but not <i class="calibre4">too</i> good. That would be an exercise in paranoia.</p>
<p class="in_para">Seeing the world accurately is not our only goal. Yes, you want reliable info to be able to make good decisions. But you also want to stay happy, motivated, and confident, even when things aren’t looking so great. (Or <i class="calibre4">especially</i> when things aren’t looking so great.) This can be a delicate balance because the truth hurts. That’s how you know it’s the truth. Sherlock Holmes was excellent at always seeing through to the brutal facts. He also became a drug addict. I’m not sure those two things are unrelated.</p>
<p class="in_para">Along similar lines, it might not be good to be an awesome lie detector either. Do you really want alarm bells going off in your head every time someone who cares about you pays you a well-intentioned but less-than-true compliment? No, you want to enjoy it. And the politeness and diplomacy requirements of most social situations (let alone job interviews and first dates) simply cannot handle utter truth 24/7. You know people who routinely ask questions they absolutely, positively do <i class="calibre4">not</i> want honest answers to, and they make you very uncomfortable. The majority of lies are not of the “I did not murder him” variety. They’re more like, “Your hair looks fantastic.” As T. S. Eliot said, “Humankind cannot bear very much reality.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Assuming people are usually honest is a preferable default. The good news is not only does it make us feel better, but over the long haul it’s actually the better bet. One study asked people <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61" title="61"></span>how much they trust others on a scale of one to ten. Income was highest among those who responded with the number eight. And low-trust people fared far worse than overtrusters. Their losses were the equivalent of not going to college. They missed many opportunities by not trusting. In <i class="calibre4">The Confidence Game</i> Maria Konnikova points to an Oxford study showing that “people with higher levels of trust were 7 percent more likely to be in better health,” and 6 percent more likely to be “very” happy rather than “pretty” happy or “not happy at all.” (Hopefully you trust me, otherwise this book isn’t going to be of much use to you.)</p>
<p class="in_para">So what’s the final verdict for the maxim? I’d love to say the “don’t judge a book by its cover” was simply true or false, but that wouldn’t be very helpful. It’s almost true . . . but misleading. The answer is more nuanced.</p>
<p class="in_para">No, we shouldn’t judge others quickly or shallowly. But as the research shows, we always <i class="calibre4">do</i>, at least initially, and that’s not gonna stop. Utterly suspending judgment isn’t possible, and, without practice, more time doesn’t make us more accurate, just more confident.</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">Instead of focusing on not judging a book by its cover, it would be more useful to say we would be better off putting more effort into revising the judgments we will undoubtedly make.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">Okay, section 1 complete. We’re done evaluating people. Now it’s time to look at how we actually deal with them. And that means friends. So we have to ask: What makes a good friend? And how can we be a good friend to others?</p>
<p class="in_para">The maxim says, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” And that maxim has been around since at least the third century <span class="make_smallcaps">B</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">C</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">E</span>. We’re going to get to the bottom of whether it’s true soon enough, but first things first: <i class="calibre4">I’m not sure we even know what it means</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Is it saying, “A friend who is in need is definitely going to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62" title="62"></span>act like your friend”? Or, “A friend who is in need is a friend in action”? Maybe, “A friend when you’re in need is definitely a friend”? Or perhaps, “A friend when you’re in need is a friend in action”?</p>
<p class="in_para">Which is it? Which do you think it is? Well, when we review the evidence, it turns out it may mean something very different from—or the exact opposite of—what you think it does. Let’s look at that next . . .</p>
