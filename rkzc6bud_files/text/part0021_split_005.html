<h2 class="chap_head" id="calibre_pb_5">4. REWRITE</h2>
<p class="in_paral">In the end, love is a shared story. (My deep and insightful realization that lasting love is inextricably part of a shared story is due to congenital brilliance on my part and has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that leading love researcher Robert Sternberg wrote a book titled <i class="calibre4">Love Is a Story</i>.)</p>
<p class="in_paral">Remember how John Gottman could predict divorce with 94 percent accuracy? Know how he does it? It’s simple: he asks the couple to tell their story. That, and that alone, is his crystal ball to the future of any romance.</p>
<p class="in_paral">So what’s your story? Every relationship has one. Sorry, did I put you on the spot? Don’t worry, I didn’t expect you to be able to answer. The stories we have about our relationships are usually intuitive and unconscious. But they’re there. Some people have a “business” story where they’re all about making sure things in the relationship run smoothly. Others do have a “fairy tale” story of wanting to save or be saved. And there are those who have a “home” story where everything is centered on building a lovely environment. There are an infinite number of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173" title="173"></span>stories. None guarantee happiness, but Sternberg found some make it pretty hard. (I recommend avoiding a “war” story.)</p>
<p class="in_paral">And people can repeat their problematic stories, which is why some friends of yours might complain, “Why do I always attract jerks?” They’re casting an actor for the “role” in their story, and decent people might not fit the part. Sternberg’s research has shown that we end up with people who have similar ideas about what the story of a relationship will be. And if they don’t, we’re far more likely to be dissatisfied with the partnership.</p>
<p class="in_paral">First, you need to know what your “ideal” relationship story is so that you can align with it, tweak it, or change it. It can be a great way to diagnose what’s wrong with a relationship, but that’s hard to do if you don’t know what your story is. If you secretly love “drama” but won’t admit it to yourself, you can say you’re seeking a “fairy tale” but keep ending up in a “war” story, saying “Jeez, why does this keep happening to me?” Often people have confusion between the story they’re seeking and the story they think they “should” have.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Our stories are influenced by upbringing and experiences, and the environment we live in. Stories are now far less culturally scripted than in the past, which is a good thing if you craft one deliberately, but if you’re not as proactive about this, it can end up more hellish than being on a group text.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Look at your past behavior to find your “ideal” story, the one you’ve been unconsciously seeking. What kinds of people did you get involved with? Reject? How has that changed? Ask friends for insight because you’re probably not going to be objective. And then you want to think about what your “actual” story currently is with your partner. Has an “adventure” story become a “running a small business” story since the kids arrived? <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174" title="174"></span>Talk to your partner and find out their “ideal” and “actual” story. Again, this is why you discussed dreams and values with them and tried to understand their ideal self. Failing to get on the same page about this is why when talking to couples who split, you often hear a <i class="calibre4">Rashomon</i> of two tales that sound completely different. Sternberg’s research found that couples with similar stories are more satisfied.</p>
<p class="in_paral">A critical element is understanding the issue of roles and power in the shared story. Today many couples have a knee-jerk desire to say they’re equals, but that may not reflect their true ideal. Do you feel uncomfortable when you’re leading or uncomfortable when not leading? Roles can be asymmetric, and that’s okay. One can be the race car driver and the other the mechanic.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Remember, there’s no “right” answer, just something both of you are comfortable with that’s in line with your needs. Yes, this is the choose-your-own-adventure marriage. Objectivity and facts aren’t central here: it’s the framing, the perspective, and the mutual buy-in. There is no objective truth here, just two subjective truths.</p>
<p class="in_paral">And that lines up with what Gottman has found about story: the facts don’t matter. It’s all about the spin. Getting his 94 percent prediction accuracy didn’t come from what the couple said but how they presented it. The single most important thing? The theme of “glorifying the struggle.” That means everything. A story of problems that has a positive spin (“We had troubles but we overcame them”) bodes well, but a story of good things with disappointment (“We’re doing fine, I guess; this isn’t what I wanted but whatever”) means problems.</p>
<p class="in_paral">The goal here is to create what journalist Daniel Jones calls “retroactive destiny.” The story isn’t the events: it’s the lens <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175" title="175"></span>you see them through. We tend to assume that the way we see things now is the only way, but a triumph can be a tragedy when you shift the perspective. The meaning can’t happen until after. You don’t find the fairy tale ready-made, and events unfold according to it. The events happen, and you weave the positive fairy tale and interpret everything through that. A cynic would say this is rationalization, but we’ve already accepted that romantic love is a type of delusion—a good kind.</p>
<p class="in_paral">NSO is a negative rewriting of the story. PSO is the positive version. The facts didn’t change, the lens did. And the story is forever being rewritten, tweaked here and there, as it certainly has in Ian’s daily telling to Michelle. Why are kids such a challenge to happy marriages? You just added a whole new primary character and didn’t update your story. Without a conscious rewriting of the storyline, you shouldn’t be surprised that a “whirlwind romance” became a “sitcom.”</p>
<p class="in_paral">As the research shows, the perfect memory of HSAM’ers harms relationships. We need to be able to rewrite and reframe. To emphasize or de-emphasize parts of the story, as we do with our partners in idealization. Luckily, we do not have HSAM, so we can rewrite the story. Instead of a new story of love through a new relationship, you can forge a new story with the same person. Think of it like recycling. Your shared story of love is quite green. As Mignon McLaughlin said, “A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person.”</p>
<p class="in_paral">It’s not going to happen overnight. But the goal of your “glorifying the struggle” story comes down to a single word: <i class="calibre4">we</i>. Professor James Pennebaker found that the use of we-words predicts a happy relationship. We already saw the other side of this. What did Gottman say often defines criticism, one of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176" title="176"></span>the four horsemen? Using the word <i class="calibre4">you</i> in an argument. UC Riverside professor Megan Robbins reviewed studies of 5,300 subjects and found that <i class="calibre4">we</i> use correlated with success in all metrics evaluated, from relationship duration to satisfaction to mental health. And it doesn’t just boost happiness. In a survey of people with heart problems, it was the ones who used <i class="calibre4">we</i> most often that were in better shape after six months.</p>
<p class="in_paral">But is the word <i class="calibre4">we</i> chicken or egg? Does it just signal a good relationship or does using it more improve a relationship? Robbins says it’s likely both. So use more <i class="calibre4">we</i>.</p>
<p class="non_para_ts">It’s almost time to round everything up. Yes, “we” are almost done. (No, you and I are not in love. You’re wonderful, but I really just think of us as friends.) We’re going to get the final verdict on love’s conquering ability. But first, you might be curious to see what love looks like when it does manage to conquer all . . .</p>
