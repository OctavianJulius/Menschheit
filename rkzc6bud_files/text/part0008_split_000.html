<p class="non_para">“I have a problem with my memory” is what the email said. And James let out a tired sigh. All the time. He gets these emails all . . . the . . . time.</p>
<p class="in_para">James McGaugh is a professor of neuroscience at UC Irvine and one of the world’s leading experts on long-term memory. But one downside of his status is an awful lot of email from strangers who misplace their keys one time and immediately assume they have Alzheimer’s. So he replied to this latest email the same way he has to all the others, referring the person to a clinic where they can be tested if they’re really concerned there’s a problem.</p>
<p class="in_para">But Jill Price immediately wrote back saying no—she needed <i class="calibre4">him</i>. James rolled his eyes. But Jill followed it up with something that made him pause, something he had never heard before. Jill repeated that she had a memory problem . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But her problem was that she never forgets. “She’s probably nuts,” he thought. But what the hell. So when Jill came in for her appointment, James took a book from his shelf. It was one of those reference books that lists all the big events of the past century. He flipped to a random page and asked, “Rodney King was beaten by LAPD officers on what day?”</p>
<p class="in_para">Jill did not hesitate. “March 3rd, 1991. It was a Sunday.” One after another, she answered flawlessly. James was surprised. The answers just popped out of her the way you’d reply if I asked your name. He’d never seen anything like this . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But then she got one wrong. James relaxed; this wasn’t as weird as it seemed. “Sorry, Jill, the Iranian Hostage Crisis happened on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32" title="32"></span>November <i class="calibre4">5th</i>, 1979.” But Jill shook her head. “No. It was on the fourth.” So James checked another source.</p>
<p class="in_para">And Jill was right. The book was wrong. James would come to realize that Jill effortlessly remembers where she was, what she did, who she was with, and how she felt for nearly every day of her adult life. But Jill’s near-perfect memory is only autobiographical. She only remembers what happened to her directly. She doesn’t remember everything she reads or learns and, frankly, didn’t do all that well in school. But because Jill is a news junkie, she was able to remember the events in James’s book.</p>
<p class="in_para">He had never seen anything remotely like this. In 2006 he published a paper, “A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering,” about his work with Jill. Initially he named her condition “Hyperthymesia,” but it later came to be known as HSAM (highly superior autobiographical memory).</p>
<p class="in_para">The study received a crush of mainstream media attention. Millions of people heard about HSAM, and thousands began contacting UC Irvine saying they had it. James began testing them, and one after another he realized that they were mistaken, crazy, or lying. But three were not. James was thrilled. Now he could start to uncover the mystery of HSAM . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Their memories were, on average, 87 percent accurate for claims that could be third-party verified. Imagine someone asking you to remember a specific day from twenty years ago, and nine times out of ten you could say what you did, who you were with, and even how you felt. How HSAM worked started to become clearer to James—and it was the <i class="calibre4">opposite</i> of what he had expected: they aren’t better at remembering. They’re just bad at forgetting. Our memories fade with time. Theirs don’t. Every day stays as clear as yesterday is for you now.</p>
<p class="in_para">And he discovered the warm upside of having such an incredible <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33" title="33"></span>memory. HSAM folks described “traveling”—revisiting their perfect memories like watching movies, almost traveling back in time. Jill’s husband had passed away. But with no exaggeration she says that “she will never forget a moment she had with him.” Pretty enviable, right? Or maybe not . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">When asked, James said he would <span class="underline">not</span> want a memory like this. <i class="calibre4">Huh?</i> You see, dear reader, when Jill sent that first email to James, she was not contacting him to talk about her “gift.” She was contacting him about her <i class="calibre4">curse</i>. She wanted a cure. She wanted it to stop.</p>
<p class="in_para">For decades, Jill’s perfect memory has plagued her. It’s like a demonic involuntary search engine, flooding her with results. She hears a date mentioned on TV, and <i class="calibre4">boom</i> she’s there. A torrent of memories she cannot stop. Breakups. Bad decisions. Regret in all its flavors. Over a lifetime there are many, many things it is good to forget.</p>
<p class="in_para">Our brains have biases. And sometimes those are for our own good. Many assume memory operates like a perfect video camera, but the truth is, memories warp with time. We forget details, reconstruct things, or change the narrative so we’re the righteous hero or the innocent victim. We forget the bad and remember the good. This helps us to heal and to put things behind us. But Jill cannot “put a new spin on things.” Her mind <i class="calibre4">is</i> that perfect video camera. She cannot rationalize, forget the details, or shift the blame.</p>
<p class="in_para">And that doesn’t even seem to be HSAM’s worst curse. What happens when a perfect memory has to deal with people who don’t have a perfect memory? There’s a different maxim for that: “Nobody likes a know-it-all.” Ever have a partner who never lets a transgression go, whose memory for your failings is always crystal clear? Multiply that times a billion.</p>
<p class="in_para">The odd part, logically speaking, is that the person with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34" title="34"></span>HSAM is right. They’re likely correct, you’re likely wrong. But human relationships don’t work like that. Nobody wants to be wrong all the time—especially if they are. We naturally expect reciprocity, shared blame, some balance, even if, strictly speaking, we don’t deserve it. “You’re right most of the time so now it’s my turn” doesn’t make rational sense when we have the hard facts. Perfect memories aren’t democratic. But relationships are. During a <i class="calibre4">60 Minutes</i> interview one HSAM’er said, “To forgive and forget . . . well, one out of two isn’t bad.”</p>
<p class="in_para">That episode featured a group of adults with the condition. All were single, and all were childless but one. Yes, Marilu Henner was married. Three times, as a matter of fact. HSAM’er Bill Brown said that out of fifty-five people he knew with the condition, only two had made a marriage work. And every single one of them he’s talked to has struggled with depression.</p>
<p class="in_para">It’s safe to say you don’t have HSAM. To this day, fewer than one hundred HSAM’ers have been confirmed. (And if you did have it, you’d remember the day you were diagnosed <i class="calibre4">perfectly</i>.) But in one small way we all have it. Let’s see how the double-edged sword of HSAM is actually the secret to understanding the double-edged sword of first impressions . . .</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">Everybody tells you first impressions are important. Guess what? They’re right. Numerous studies show first impressions have a huge impact, not only during that initial encounter, but long after. First impressions are so powerful that snap judgments consistently predict elections. Alex Todorov, a professor at Princeton and an expert on the psychology of faces, says that merely asking people “Which candidate looks more competent?” can tell you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35" title="35"></span>who’s going to come out on top in political races 70 percent of the time—an effect that has been replicated around the world. And there’s a solid correlation between recruiters’ pre-interview and post-interview impressions of job applicants, indicating that someone’s initial exposure to you may be the most important factor in whether you land that new gig.</p>
<p class="in_para">The maxim might be “don’t judge a book by its cover,” and, right or wrong, there’s a good reason such advice is given: because we <i class="calibre4">do</i> judge a book by its cover. Immediately and instinctively. We can’t help it. And that cover is usually someone’s face. We make our minds up about someone’s assertiveness, beauty, competence, likability, and trustworthiness in less than a second. And, like mind reading, more time doesn’t noticeably change our opinions, it just increases our confidence.</p>
<p class="in_para">More interesting is that not only are these judgments immediate but they’re also consistently shared. Faces I see as trustworthy, dominant, or competent are very likely ones you’ll see the same way. Fundamentally, these decisions are not rational. There’s no time to think them through. They’re usually based on shared beliefs and to a lesser extent our personal experiences with others.</p>
<p class="in_para">The kicker? <i class="calibre4">Our first impressions are often surprisingly accurate.</i> Not only do people usually agree on first impressions, but they’re also impressively predictive. Just seeing someone smile for the first time was enough for viewers to make accurate predictions two-thirds of the time for nine out of ten fundamental personality traits, from extroversion to self-esteem to political preferences.</p>
<p class="in_para">You’re also good at instinctively determining someone’s competence after a brief encounter. When people watch a thirty-second silent video of a teacher in class, they’re able to predict student evaluations. Watch someone for five minutes, and accuracy can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36" title="36"></span>go as high as 70 percent. Our ability to intuit what someone’s like from thin slices of behavior is powerful across a number of domains, providing above-chance levels of accuracy in determining if someone is smart, wealthy, altruistic, or whether they’re a psychopath. Again, these impressions aren’t rational. That means you’re actually <i class="calibre4">more</i> accurate when you think <i class="calibre4">less</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Some people might be saying, “Thank god. We can just trust our gut. Whew.” Hold your horses. We’re still talking about human beings here. Nothing is gonna be that simple. Yes, our instincts are good. Good to the 70 percent accuracy level. Would you be happy if your kid brought home all Ds on a report card? I didn’t think so.</p>
<p class="in_para">And, unsurprisingly, a fair amount of this inaccuracy is due to your biased brain. We’re not talking about race or gender biases necessarily, but fundamental cognitive biases wired into our gray matter. Often these are shortcuts. Evolution has optimized our brains for speed or fuel efficiency over accuracy.</p>
<p class="in_para">And that’s why baby-faced people get away with murder. I’m not being metaphorical. Studies show baby-faced people are more likely to triumph in legal cases where they’re accused of deliberate harm—but more likely to lose when the accusation is negligence. Why? We expect children to make mistakes but have trouble believing they’re evil. Our brains extend that to include baby-faced adults in a process known as “overgeneralization.” But are baby-faced people actually more innocent? Nope. Baby-faced young men “showed more negativity in childhood and puberty, more quarrelsomeness and lying in puberty, and more assertiveness and hostility in adolescence, all of which contradict impressions of babyfaced individuals.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Now if you think you can overcome these biases with conscious effort, you’re probably wrong. Numerous studies have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37" title="37"></span>shown we have a bias against noticing our biases. Even if you explain them and point them out (as I’m doing right now), people will see them more often in others but become convinced that they themselves are objective. And it gets even more complicated—some biases <i class="calibre4">help</i>. To the extent that a bias is accurate, studies show what you would logically expect: eliminating it makes your predictions less accurate. Yeesh.</p>
<p class="in_para">We’re prone to zillions of cognitive biases, and there’s no way to succinctly address them all. But when it comes to first impressions, the main battle is with “confirmation bias.” We’re prone to searching for and favoring ideas consistent with beliefs we already hold. We don’t test theories; we look for information to reinforce the position we’ve already decided on.</p>
<p class="in_para">If you look, you can notice others (and yourself) subtly engaging in confirmation bias all the time. Our standards drop for what is necessary to prove our theories, but they go up for the amount of evidence required to disprove them. (“Four hundred studies say I’m wrong? Well, we should keep looking . . . One says I’m correct? Looks like we have our answer.”) It’s just like what we saw with cold reading: we remember hits, we forget the misses. And we all do this. Yes, even you. No one thinks they’re the problem, and that’s the problem.</p>
<p class="in_para">As researcher Nicholas Epley says, “Your sixth sense works quickly and is not prone to second-guessing.” Once we get a story in our heads about who someone is, it’s very hard for us to update it. And this leads us to our primary insight about the double-edged sword of first impressions. We’ll call it <b class="calibre6">The First Impressions Paradox™</b>.</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">First impressions are generally accurate. But once they’re set, they’re extremely hard to change.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">When it comes to first impressions, it’s like we have HSAM: <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38" title="38"></span>we don’t alter our memories. We’re all but locked-in to our prior judgments. And it can dramatically affect our relationships. We often think about the perils of stereotyping groups, but we also do the same thing with individuals. Someone has an “untrustworthy” face when you first meet them, so you’re less warm than usual. Because you’re distant with them, they’re distant with you. This reasonable response on their part triggers your confirmation bias. (“See, I knew they weren’t a nice person!”) Now you’re both wary of each other. And that’s the most scientific explanation you’ll ever get for what it means when two people “don’t click.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Some will say that they do update their first impressions, and certainly at times that does happen. But there’s another sinister effect hiding beneath the surface. Even when presented with incontrovertible new information about someone, our explicit impressions can change while our implicit impressions don’t. In other words, your very rational, evidence-based perspective can change, but your <i class="calibre4">feelings</i> about the person stay exactly the same. First impressions are sticky, even when we think they’ve been overcome.</p>
<p class="in_para">We’ll never totally resist this, but we can improve with effort. First, we need to keep in mind the same principles we learned with reading thoughts and feelings. Motivation is critical, and focusing on making others more readable will deliver bigger improvements than trying to improve your reading skills.</p>
<p class="in_para">But the critical thing is resisting the dreaded black hole of confirmation bias lock-in. Our brains are going to start generating theories and stories about someone within milliseconds. That’s fine (and impossible to stop), but we need to keep an open mind. We want to take a scientific approach of hypothesis testing versus blindly accepting the first impression we get.</p>
<p class="in_para">So how do we resist confirmation bias? Three key steps:</p>
