<p class="non_para">Standing in your socks with no coat isn’t fun when temperatures drop below zero. But it’s even worse when a few hundred soldiers are coming to kill you.</p>
<p class="in_para">The other members of his squad lay wounded nearby. From the creek bed where he took cover, he could see the enemy closing in. Running was still an option . . . But not for Hector. Hector Cafferata wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p class="in_para">Okay, let’s rewind a bit. It’s November 28, 1950, during the Korean War. Hector’s small squad of US Marines was tasked with protecting a three-mile mountain pass, basically an escape route that the eleven-thousand-troop First Marine Division might need in case of trouble. With six inches of snow on the ground, it was so cold that Hector’s squad couldn’t even dig foxholes, so he and his buddy Kenneth Benson (“Bens”) cut down small trees to build shelter and then got in their sleeping bags.</p>
<p class="in_para">What they didn’t know was that a huge unit of Chinese soldiers was advancing on their position. At around 1:30 <span class="make_smallcaps">A</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">M</span>. Hector was startled awake by gunfire. Explosions. Screams. The bodies of his wounded friends all around. Enemy soldiers literally thirty feet away. There would not be time to put on boots. A grenade exploded nearby. It didn’t harm Hector—but Bens was blinded by the flash. For the rest of the night he would be unable to see.</p>
<p class="in_para">Hector grabbed his rifle and returned fire, but there were simply too many of them, too close, coming too fast. Hector told Bens, “Hang on to my foot. We’re going to crawl.” They retreated to a trench for cover.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66" title="66"></span>Surveying the scene, Hector realized the rest of his squad was incapacitated. And a regimental-size group of enemy soldiers was closing in. Private First Class Hector Cafferata, who had only two weeks of training before being shipped off to Korea, was the last man standing. He looked around at his wounded pals. And then he got to work.</p>
<p class="in_para">What did he do? Look, you’re gonna need to forgive me here because I’m going to use a total cliché. But I swear to you this may be the only time this cliché was ever 100 percent accurate and not the least bit of an exaggeration at all . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Hector Cafferata became a one-man army.</p>
<p class="in_para">Ankle-deep in snow and wearing socks, Hector transformed into the stuff of summer action movies. As dozens of enemy soldiers attacked with bullets, grenades, and mortars, Hector single-handedly held the line. Heck, he didn’t just hold the line: he made them retreat for cover. Racing back and forth through the creek bed as bullets whizzed by and all manner of things exploded left and right, <i class="calibre4">one freakin’ guy</i> made a regimental-size unit call for reinforcements.</p>
<p class="in_para">Sound ridiculous? Think I’m making this up? Well, strap in because it gets even crazier: Hector batted away incoming grenades with a shovel. I’m going to repeat that: <i class="calibre4">he batted away incoming grenades with a shovel</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Hector fired his M1 rifle so much that it overheated and briefly caught fire. He would plunge it into the snow to cool it down and resume shooting. Bens, still blind, would load bullets into eight-round clips by feel and hand them to Hector when he heard the empty “click” of the rifle.</p>
<p class="in_para">The enemy tossed a grenade into the gully where Hector’s teammates lay bleeding. He dashed toward it and threw it back out. But Hector wasn’t quick enough. It detonated before it was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67" title="67"></span>clear, shredding one of his fingers and sending shrapnel into his arm. Didn’t matter. Hector kept fighting, enemy soldiers just fifteen feet away. And he kept this up for <i class="calibre4">five hours</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Then a shot rang out above the others. A sniper’s bullet slammed into Hector’s chest. He dropped. He struggled to get back up, but his body couldn’t obey. On the ground, he looked at his fallen buddies . . . and beyond them, in the distance, Hector saw US Marine reinforcements cresting the hill. It was going to be okay.</p>
<p class="in_para">Hector would spend over a year recovering. After leaving the hospital, he headed to the White House. President Harry Truman awarded him the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration a member of the US armed forces can receive. If you check the official records, it says he killed fifteen of the enemy. But that number isn’t even remotely accurate. In an interview, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Robert McCarthy, said it was closer to one hundred. Military officials changed the forms because they knew nobody would believe the real number.</p>
<p class="in_para">“To tell you the truth, I did it. I know I did it. Other people know I did it. But I’ll be God damned if I know how I did it. Put it that way.” That’s Hector, years later. He didn’t know <i class="calibre4">how</i> he did it, but he knew <i class="calibre4">why</i>. And it wasn’t because he was a patriot who loved his country. Hector certainly was a patriot who loved his country, but that’s not why he did it. In fact, it’s not why any Medal of Honor winner has ever done it. Review the stories of the soldiers granted that award, and you’ll see the same reason over and over again. Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy stated it plainly. When asked why he risked his life, taking on a full company of German soldiers during World War II, he replied:</p>
<p class="in_para">“They were killing my friends.”</p>
<p class="in_para">The same was true for Hector. As he said in an interview, “I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_68" title="68"></span>don’t think I gave any of it conscious thought. You have friends there who are wounded and hurt. You decide you have to stick it out. The thought of leaving never occurred to me.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Hector’s friends were definitely friends in need. And Hector was a friend “in deed” <i class="calibre4">and</i> “indeed.” I’d love a friend like Hector. (Actually, I’d love a Hector Cafferata action figure with removable socks and a spring-loaded shovel arm.)</p>
<p class="in_para">No one would dispute that friends are one of the most important things in life. But there’s a mystery at the heart of friendship that we need to get to the bottom of . . .</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">Old friends in the highlands of Papua New Guinea greet each other by saying “Den neie,” which translates to “I should like to eat your intestines.” Uh, suffice to say, <i class="calibre4">some</i> ideas about friendship vary around the world. But many things are similar globally. On the islands of Micronesia, close friends are called <i class="calibre4">pwiipwin le sopwone wa</i>, which means “my sibling from the same canoe”—which is pretty close to “brother from another mother” if you think about it.</p>
<p class="in_para">One thing is certain: friendship is universal. The Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) at Yale University tracks the 400 most studied cultures around the world, and 395 appear to have a concept of friendship. (The five that don’t are communities that explicitly discourage friendship as a threat to the family unit or political structures.) And BFFs aren’t limited to humans, or even primates for that matter. Researchers have documented that elephants, dolphins, whales, and other mammals also have buddies.</p>
<p class="in_para">Reported in 93 percent of societies surveyed, <i class="calibre4">mutual aid</i> is the most agreed-on quality of friendship, and nearly every society <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_69" title="69"></span>also has a prohibition on “keeping score” in a friendship. With strangers, it’s cash on the barrelhead, right now. But being friends means ignoring the strict accounting of favors. In fact, strict reciprocity is actually a profound <i class="calibre4">negative</i> in friendship. Being in a hurry to repay a debt is often seen as an insult. With buddies we act like costs and benefits don’t matter (or at least not nearly as much).</p>
<p class="in_para">A 2009 study found Americans, on average, have four close relationships, two of which are friends. Yale professor Nicholas Christakis notes that those stats haven’t changed much in the past few decades, and you get similar numbers when you look around the globe. And while the majority of studies show quality is more important than quantity when it comes to friends, numbers still matter. Which folks are 60 percent more likely to consider themselves “very happy”? Those who have five or more friends they can talk about their troubles with.</p>
<p class="in_para">Unsurprisingly, we have the most friends when we’re young (teens average about nine), and the number generally declines as we age. Which is sad, because friends make us happier than any other relationship. Sorry, spouses. Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman found that when you survey people in the moment, their happiness levels are highest while with friends. Doesn’t matter if you survey the young or old, or go anywhere around the world, pals take the title nearly every time. To be fair, research by Beverley Fair shows that we’re the absolute happiest when with both friends and spouses. But even <i class="calibre4">within</i> a marriage, friendship reigns. Work by Gallup found that 70 percent of marital satisfaction is due to the couple’s friendship. Tom Rath says it’s five times as critical to a good marriage as physical intimacy.</p>
<p class="in_para">Amigo impact in the office is no less significant. Less than 20 percent of people see their manager as a “close friend”—but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70" title="70"></span>those who do are 2.5 times more likely to enjoy their job. Do you have three pals at work? Then you’re 96 percent more likely to feel happy about your life. To be clear, that result was not “happy with your job”; it was happy with <i class="calibre4">life</i>. And while we would all love a raise, a 2008 <i class="calibre4">Journal of Socio-Economics</i> study found that while changes in income provide only a minor increase in happiness, more time with friends boosts your smiling to the equivalent of an extra ninety-seven thousand dollars a year. (Go ask your boss for a 97K raise and see how well that goes over.) Overall, friendship variables account for about 58 percent of your happiness.</p>
<p class="in_para">Your friends are also critical in maintaining your not-dead status. Work by Julianne Holt-Lunstad found that loneliness affects your health the same way smoking fifteen cigarettes a day does. And once again, friendship reigns supreme over other connections. A 2006 study compared breast cancer patients who had ten close friends to those who had zero. Being in the first group quadrupled the women’s chance of survival—but, more surprisingly, a husband had zero impact. Same thing for men. A long-term study of 736 guys showed friends reduced the likelihood of heart problems. Once again, a romantic partner didn’t.</p>
<p class="in_para">Okay, we get it: friends are a good thing. But we’re here to answer a more specific question: <i class="calibre4">Is a “friend in need a friend indeed”?</i> Problem is, you and I can’t even get started on that issue because we have a much more fundamental problem: <i class="calibre4">we don’t even know what a friend really is</i>. Go ahead, define it. I’ll wait. And no, I’m not going to accept some pyramid scheme of clichés as an answer. We’ve all heard a million definitions of friendship that sound like a Hallmark Card, but those aren’t effective litmus tests.</p>
<p class="in_para">Are your Facebook “friends” really friends? How about the old friend you have great memories with . . . but never bother to talk <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71" title="71"></span>to? Or the fun person you always have an absolute blast with but would never trust to watch your kids? That reliable person you can count on for anything but would never call for solace if you received a medical test containing the word <i class="calibre4">malignant</i>? Are they a friend? Truly defining that common little word is a lot trickier than you think.</p>
<p class="in_para">Christakis says, “We can formally define friendship as a typically volitional, long-term relationship, ordinarily between unrelated individuals, that involves mutual affection and support, possibly asymmetric, especially in times of need.” A solid, formal definition for research—but I don’t think that’s going to help you and me day-to-day.</p>
<p class="in_para">And its nebulous definition is emblematic of a larger problem: friendship gets screwed. Despite the cornucopia of positives mentioned above, including the number one spot for both happiness and health, friendship almost always takes a back seat to spouses, kids, extended family, even co-workers. We’ll pay for a child therapist for our kids, a marriage counselor for our union, but nothing for friendship. If it has problems, we often just let it die like a pet goldfish. Daniel Hruschka, a professor and friendship researcher at Arizona State University, points out that <i class="calibre4">friend</i> is both spoken and written more than any other relational term in the English language, even <i class="calibre4">mother</i> and <i class="calibre4">father</i>. And yet this vital, powerful, happiness-inducing, life-saving relationship consistently gets the short end of the stick in everyday life. What’s the deal?</p>
<p class="in_para">Unlike those other relationships, friendship has no formal institution. It doesn’t have law, religion, employer, or blood backing it up. And because there’s no metaphorical lobbying group pushing friendships’ interests, it always ends up second tier. It’s 100 percent voluntary with no clear definition and few societally agreed-on expectations. If you go without speaking to your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72" title="72"></span>spouse for six weeks, expect divorce papers. If you don’t talk to a friend for that long . . . <i class="calibre4">meh</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">With no formal rules, expectations are blurry. This renders friendships fragile. They wilt without care, but there are no rules for what is required, and negotiating specifics is uncomfortable. Don’t show up for work, and you know your boss will fire you. But what calls for the ending of a friendship is often idiosyncratic. And so it’s no surprise that when you survey young and old, you consistently find that within seven years, half of current friends are no longer close confidantes anymore. Without institutional obligations, the upkeep friendships require must be very deliberate. And in a busy world, that is beyond what most of us can handle. Often the thirties are the decade where friendships go to die. Around that time is when you gather all your friends for your wedding—and then promptly never see them again. Jobs, marriages, and children demand more and more as we age, and that frequently comes out of the buddy budget. Despite all the joys and benefits of friendship, studies show that the person we are most likely to have a lifelong relationship with turns out to be not a pal but a sibling. It’s a tragedy.</p>
<p class="in_para">However, the weakness of friendship is also the source of its immeasurable strength. Why do true friendships make us happier than spouses or children? Because they’re always a deliberate choice, never an obligation. Not supported by any institution, neither is friendship forced on us by any institution. Quite simply: you have to like your friends. Other relationships can exist independent of emotion. Someone does not cease to be your parent, boss, or spouse because you stop liking them. Friendship is more real because either person can walk away at any time. Its fragility proves its purity.</p>
<p class="in_para">And then there’s an exponentially larger institution that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73" title="73"></span>friendship must contend with, and one that provides our biggest challenge to an accurate definition of the word: biology. In a ruthless natural world (somewhere right now a lion is biting into a gazelle) where everything is reduced to the Darwinistic need to spread our genes, why do friends exist? Family, and the need to provide for that family, should be everything, right?</p>
<p class="in_para">Sure, friends can offer help in achieving those goals and then the math works . . . but then it’s all math. Transactional relationships. In that case we’d evaluate friends based solely on what they could do for us and make sure we always profited from the exchange. But that’s not the case—an absence of strict reciprocity is one of the few universals about friendship. More important, it doesn’t resonate with our emotional idea of friendship at all. It leaves no room for real altruism or kindness in the world. If life is spreading your genes and gaining resources, as biology might seem to say, why did Hector risk his life for his friends? Is that what the “friend in need” maxim means? That friends are only true to us when we or they need something?</p>
<p class="in_para">Wow, we started out trying to get a simple definition of the word <i class="calibre4">friend</i> and somehow ended up in a 3 <span class="make_smallcaps">A</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">M</span>. dorm room philosophy discussion trying to solve the nature of altruism in the universe. But all this does matter. It’s critical to getting a real definition of what a friend is—and is not. In fact, this issue of altruism was Darwin’s white whale. He said it was the biggest mystery, and if he couldn’t solve it, he feared that his theory of natural selection would prove false.</p>
<p class="in_para">And that’s why we need to look at the tragic story of George Price. Grab the tissues. This is a tough one . . .</p>
