<section title="Chapter 19" epub:type="bodymatter">
<h2 class="chap_num" id="ch19"><span class="right_" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_225" title="225"></span><a href="part0003.html#rch19" class="calibre3">19</a></h2>
<p class="non_para">Legally, they were already dead. Everything they owned was taken from them. Their marriages had been annulled. But they had become accustomed to horrible treatment. They were lepers. Literally.</p>
<p class="in_para">It was 1866, and the territory of Hawaii was “fixing” its leprosy dilemma. Frightened of the disease, the authorities decided to exile lepers to the island of Molokai. There were sixteen; only four were relatively healthy. Two were very sick. Soon three more would be gravely ill as well.</p>
<p class="in_para">There would be no hospital, no staff to care for them on Molokai. They were provided with almost nothing. Some blankets and some farming tools they didn’t even know how to use. Enough food to last only a few days. The huts on the island were in disrepair. To say they were left to survive on their own would be too generous; they were abandoned to die.</p>
<p class="in_para">And they were strangers, not a family or a group of friends. There was simply no reason for the healthy to help the sick. In fact, quite the opposite. If the fit kept all the food for themselves and didn’t waste time tending to the weak, they would greatly increase their chances of survival. The salt pork and sea biscuits would last weeks if split among the four who were healthiest.</p>
<p class="in_para">Only triage would allow them to create a livable existence. It was time to ditch the weak. They were burdensome strangers who would cause them all to die. It was the only rational thing to do . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">The ship returned two weeks later, not to bring aid, but to drop off more lepers. And the crew was stunned by what they saw.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226" title="226"></span>The huts were fixed. Crops had been sown. Fires burned 24/7 to keep the sick warm. Fresh water had been found. The healthiest had not taken the food for themselves; they spent all their time caring for the weak. The others cooked and tended to the sustainable life they had started to build. And every single one of the initial group was alive.</p>
<p class="in_para">The strong didn’t do the “rational” thing and choose selfish survival. They operated on instinct. Human nature. They made the seemingly irrational choice to care.</p>
<p class="in_para">A “just-so” story? Hardly. As detailed in <i class="calibre4">Pirates, Prisoners, and Lepers: Lessons from Life Outside the Law</i>, University of Pennsylvania professor Paul Robinson and Sarah Robinson explain that this response has been seen over and over in groups that find themselves in the most dire of situations, all around the world, all throughout history. Not always, but very often. Because “irrational” cooperation is what led to our success as a species.</p>
<p class="in_para">We forget that our supremacy on this planet was far from fated. We lived on the edge of extinction for most of the 125,000 generations of Homo sapiens. The ultimate proof is that if we didn’t cooperate more often than not, if we didn’t take the gamble and choose to help when it didn’t make sense, quite simply: <i class="calibre4">you would not be here reading this</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">The Molokai leper colony actually was an island. But what it proves is that you and I are not.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">So what have we learned?</p>
<p class="in_para">Loneliness sucks and we’re lonelier than ever, but it’s less about a lack of people and more about lack of community. And loneliness is new, born of our relatively recent story of individualism. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227" title="227"></span>We could also use a little more deliberate solitude to be more creative, to find wisdom, and to get in touch with ourselves. But, no, we don’t need as much as our hermit Chris Knight got. (Harvard psychologist Jill Hooley actually believes he has schizoid personality disorder. If you don’t, you’re gonna require more people time than he did.) We need a balance between community and solitude, like we had pre-nineteenth century, but right now we’re not getting enough of either.</p>
<p class="in_para">Popularity is a good thing, but as a culture we’re choosing the wrong kind, opting for status, power, and fame over being likable. This generally doesn’t lead to good things, and that’s why your daughter wants to be a celebrity assistant instead of a CEO. The lack of community makes our gray matter feel unsafe, pushing us toward a greater need for control in our lives and relationships. This has led to choosing parasocial relationships with technology, which are unfulfilling. Social media isn’t evil, but since we often use it to replace real relationships and community, its harms frequently outweigh its positives. Machiavelli said if you have to choose between being loved or feared, choose feared. But you’re not a prince, so sorry, we all need a bit more love. As Pepperdine psychology professor Louis Cozolino puts it, “The problem is, when you depend on a substitute for love, you can never get enough.” And please do not fall in love with a pillow.</p>
<p class="in_para">Happiness is down and depression is up as a result of our hyperindividualistic society. We’ve tried to cope via the placebo effects of antidepressants and the pseudo-cuddles of opiates, but that’s not going to do it. What we need is more community. It’s our natural state, and when disaster briefly peels back modernity, we can see how naturally good and cooperative we are. When life is at its worst, we’re at our best, as we’ve shown time and time again from Katrina to Molokai. When the need for status is cast <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228" title="228"></span>aside, when we’re “in it together,” facing our collective problems, we find that personal comfort matters little, we don’t need the obsessive control, we sacrifice for one another, and, shockingly, we feel better. Let’s not wait for catastrophe or war. We can take a lesson from the Amish and better prioritize community. As the placebo research shows us, we all need to know that someone is looking out for us. That we’re not alone. That despite whatever ails us, help is on the way.</p>
<p class="in_para">What’s the final verdict on this section’s maxim? Do I even need to say it? Okay, for the record:</p>
<p class="in_para">“No man is an island” = True.</p>
<p class="in_para">The 1800s brought revolutionary new ideas that led to a lot of good things but also to some not-so-good-things. Individualism went a little too far, and we ended up nutritionally deficient on community, resulting in emotional scurvy. And that’s where our lovely theme of “story” comes back. How do stories play into community? Lee Marvin once said, “Death is only the end if you assume the story is about you.”</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">You’re not the only character in the story.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">The story is not a “one-man show.” Maybe it’s an hour drama (or on bad days, a sitcom), but if this thing doesn’t have a full cast of characters, it’s going to be a tragedy. Heck, if you have kids you might not even be the main character in the story anymore, but instead the wise mentor who aids the protagonist in the journey ahead. (Me? I’m just the comic relief.)</p>
<p class="in_para">Consciously, we always strive for more autonomy and control, but deep down a “one-man show” is not what we’re wired for. If we were, the placebo effect wouldn’t work. You need someone to tell you “it’s going to be okay.” The hero needs to save others and occasionally be saved themselves.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229" title="229"></span>Whoa. We made it through the final chapter. You and me. <i class="calibre4">We</i> did it.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now it’s time to solve the biggest mystery of them all: the meaning of life. We’ve got a handful of pages left. Shouldn’t be that hard, right?</p>
<p class="in_para">Let’s begin our ending with one final story . . .</p>
