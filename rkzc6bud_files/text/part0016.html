<p class="non_para">The two men could not have been more different: a pornographer and a preacher.</p>
<p class="in_para">In the 1970s Larry Flynt built a full-fledged porn empire with <i class="calibre4">Hustler</i> magazine as its crown jewel. To be clear, Larry didn’t make “erotica”—he made <i class="calibre4">porn</i>. The sophistication of <i class="calibre4">Playboy</i> magazine was anathema to him. It was phony. He was utterly tasteless—and frequently hysterical. Flynt was a spitfire, satirizing authority with crazy antics, publicity stunts, and chaos. Not without principles, Flynt was ahead of his time in support of abortion, the rights of homosexuals and minorities, and, most of all, free speech. After <i class="calibre4">Hustler</i> posted photos of interracial sex, Flynt was shot by a white supremacist and confined to a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="in_para">And if Flynt was emblematic of the wild 1970s, Jerry Falwell could not have better represented the mainstream 1950s. The televangelist led the surge of the religious right in America as a political force to be reckoned with, helping to elect Ronald Reagan. His outspoken conservative stances espoused traditional values and condemned what he saw as the collapse of morality in the seventies. His lobbying group, the Moral Majority, railed against abortion, homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment, and, of course, porn.</p>
<p class="in_para">Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, Falwell publicly bashed Flynt as symbolizing everything that was wrong with the country. And Flynt was growing tired of being smeared by someone he thought of as a hypocritical windbag. <i class="calibre4">Hustler</i>’s editorial meetings had always begun by asking “Who haven’t we offended this month?” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104" title="104"></span>And for their latest target, Flynt selected none other than Falwell. The magazine published a satirical liquor “advertisement” where Falwell would be talking about losing his virginity. In a Virginia outhouse. To his mother.</p>
<p class="in_para">Larry just saw it as his turn to hit back in the ongoing debate. He didn’t think it was that big a deal. But Falwell sure did. Accusing Flynt of libel and emotional distress, in October 1983 Falwell sued him . . . for forty-five million dollars. The “cold” war had just gone nuclear.</p>
<p class="in_para">Falwell saw it as nothing less than a battle between good and evil. And he had the high ground. Formal courts of law were the arena of the traditional, the squares. Falwell would use the full power of the mainstream system as a cudgel to bludgeon Flynt, the immoral outsider.</p>
<p class="in_para">Larry’s reaction? A yawn. You have to realize, being sued was not a once-in-a-lifetime problem for him. It was more like an every-Thursday problem. In the film <i class="calibre4">The People vs. Larry Flynt</i>, Flynt tells his attorney: “I’m a lawyer’s dream client. I’m rich, I’m fun, and I’m always in trouble.”</p>
<p class="in_para">And while it was true that the courtroom played to Falwell’s strengths, Flynt was a brilliant tactician with courtroom trolling abilities that tested the bounds of human comprehension. The judge would fine him, and Larry would pay in one-dollar bills, dumped on the courtroom floor by a cavalcade of hookers and porn stars. When the judge fined him again, he did it again . . . this time paying in pennies. If Falwell was a formal military using the courts as a battleground, Flynt was a rebel guerrilla force, well versed in unconventional warfare, and no less well funded. And he impishly printed the offending satirical ad <i class="calibre4">again</i> in the February 1984 issue of <i class="calibre4">Hustler</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105" title="105"></span>But Larry lost the lawsuit. Yeah, he was making a mockery of the system and stealing the headlines with his antics, but Falwell was winning where it mattered—in the courts. Larry’s nemesis had won. But Larry was not about to give in. He appealed . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">And lost <i class="calibre4">again</i>. Flynt had already spent more than two million dollars on the case. His lawyers wanted to quit. The Sun Tzu warrior was now fighting uphill with the sun in his eyes. But he could not stand to give in to his sworn enemy. This was a battle to the death. So the smut peddler played the only card he had left: he appealed to the United States Supreme Court. And on March 20, 1987, they agreed to hear the case.</p>
<p class="in_para">And Flynt won. Actually, he didn’t just win; it was a unanimous decision. If satirists could be sued into silence every time they said something negative about a celebrity, it imperiled the first amendment. <i class="calibre4">Hustler v. Falwell</i> is now routinely taught in law schools and regarded as one of the most important free speech cases of the twentieth century. But more important: Flynt defeated his enemy Falwell, and did so spectacularly.</p>
<p class="in_para">It’s an amazing story. So amazing that it was made into a film in 1996, garnering multiple Oscar nominations. And most people think it ended there. It didn’t . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">After the trial Jerry paid a surprise visit to Larry. Falwell walked in holding up his hands and saying, “I surrender!” He had come to bury the hatchet. The two talked for an hour, and Falwell suggested that they do a series of debates together. Flynt accepted.</p>
<p class="in_para">Held mostly on college campuses, the two sparred over the issue of free speech. And, over time, something started to change between them. They didn’t enter auditoriums separately, as prize-fighters might. Falwell would push Larry’s wheelchair for him. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106" title="106"></span>Sure, they were always jabbing at each other, but a respect began to grow. Almost a liking. Flynt would joke that Jerry was his pastor. Falwell would fire right back: “And Larry is my most rebellious parishioner!” It got a big laugh from the audience.</p>
<p class="in_para">On tour, they spent a lot of time together—that “costly signal” we discussed. And both the pornographer and the preacher realized that they were more similar than they had thought. Both were southern boys—one from Kentucky, the other from Virginia. Falwell’s father had owned a nightclub and been a bootlegger. Flynt himself had owned a number of nightclubs in Ohio and been a bootlegger as well. They had waged war for over five years. Flynt said, “I disagreed with him on absolutely everything: gay rights, a woman’s right to choose, everything. But after getting to know him, I realized he was sincere. He wasn’t out to get a buck.”</p>
<p class="in_para">The two opposed everything the other stood for, tore each other apart in the media, and spent millions fighting a lawsuit that dragged on for half a decade. But eventually it came to pass that they had been <i class="calibre4">not-enemies</i> longer than they had been enemies. Over the ensuing years they changed each other’s minds about, well . . . nothing. But they made time for each other. They went out of their way to see each other. Falwell would drop by whenever he was in California. When one was in need, the other was there. When Falwell struggled with health complications due to his obesity, Flynt recommended a diet that had worked for him. Every year they exchanged Christmas cards and pictures of their grandchildren.</p>
<p class="in_para">On May 15, 2007, Jerry Falwell was discovered unconscious in his office and was raced to the hospital. Efforts to resuscitate him failed, and he died of cardiac arrythmia at age seventy-three. And on May 20 the <i class="calibre4">Los Angeles Times</i> posted an op-ed that was basically an obituary. It was written by none other than Larry Flynt. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_107" title="107"></span>He recounted their (literal) trials and tribulations. Their ups and downs. And he concluded it by saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="extract">The ultimate result was one I never expected and was just as shocking a turn to me as was winning that famous Supreme Court case: We became friends.</p>
</div>
<p class="in_para">If the pornographer and the preacher could look at each other and find “another self,” I’d say there’s hope for all of us. Time to round up everything we’ve learned and find out whether “a friend in need is a friend indeed” is actually true.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">So what have we learned?</p>
<p class="in_para">Empathy is when the line between you and another blurs. Closeness is when your vision of your “self” makes room for someone else to be in there too. And a true friend is “another self.” A part of you. Aristotle said it first, and after procrastinating for a few millennia, science proved him right.</p>
<p class="in_para">Friendship may be defined by mutual aid, but it’s not transactional. We don’t keep score with friends. Our brains tell us the story that friends are a part of us, and this is how we overcome the dictates of ruthless Darwinism and act altruistically, as Hector Cafferata did.</p>
<p class="in_para">There is no formal institution that regulates friendship. This makes friendship fragile but pure. It’s why friends make us happier than any other relationship—they’re only there because you truly want them to be. But without a marriage certificate, a blood bond, or a contract to support it, we must be diligent in investing in and protecting our friendships to sustain them.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108" title="108"></span>Dale Carnegie got the initial parts of meeting people right, but we must display the costly signals of time and vulnerability to forge and maintain true friendships that will last. Those with Williams syndrome show us what we must aspire to, a fearless open love that sees in others more good than danger.</p>
<p class="in_para">And we will meet people who just ain’t always so nice. In fact, we already have many of them in our lives. With low-level narcissists we can use the empathy prompts of similarity, vulnerability, and community to remind them of the warmth they lack, and that they so desperately need. Daniel Kahneman’s mother knew that people are complex, and sometimes they just need an emotional nudge so that they stop trying to be special and start trying to be better.</p>
<p class="in_para">And now that we know how friendship works, we’re finally ready to address the big question: Is the maxim “a friend in need is a friend indeed” true? Well, as we learned at the end of the last section, there’s some debate over what the phrase even means—but in that debate I think we actually learn a lot about friendship.</p>
<p class="in_para">Two things are unclear in the maxim: (1) Who is the person in need? You or your friend? And (2), is the end of the sentence meant to be “in deed” or “indeed”? That gives us four contenders for the correct interpretation.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li class="bul" value="1">“A friend when you’re in need is definitely a friend.”</li>
<li class="bul" value="2">“A friend when you’re in need will show it with their actions.”</li>
<li class="bul" value="3">“A friend who is in need is definitely going to act like your friend.”</li>
<li class="bul" value="4">“A friend who is in need is a friend in action.”</li>
</ol>
<p class="in_para">And here’s where things really get interesting. Scholars are agreed on what they believe the phrase was intended to mean. But <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109" title="109"></span>when you survey the average Joe and Jane, they prefer a different interpretation. Which one do you think historians believe was the intended meaning and which one do you think the average person preferred? Ponder that for a second; I’ll just sit here and hum the <i class="calibre4">Jeopardy</i> music.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now number 4 doesn’t even make much sense. That one’s out. Number 3 might be true (and, wow, is that cynical), but neither group picked that one. Final answer? Academics believe that number 2 was the intended meaning of the phrase: <i class="calibre4">A friend when you’re in need will show it with their actions.</i> But the average person preferred number 1: <i class="calibre4">A friend when you’re in need is definitely a friend.</i></p>
<p class="in_para">So everyone’s agreed that you’re the one in need. But we’re still unresolved on the “in deed” versus “indeed” debate. Forgive me if I’m splitting hairs, but we can separate the two by the emphasis between “deeds” versus just “being there.” The “correct” one sounds slightly more transactional than the popular one: “What will you do for me?” versus “Be there for me.” It’s the same Darwin versus Aristotle debate. Number 2 is more rational like George Price’s math. Number 1 is more like “another self.” I don’t think it’s any surprise most people preferred the latter. We’re just wired to prefer connection over calculating benefit when it comes to friends. We want “another self.”</p>
<p class="in_para">To give the historical version its due, it’s warning us about fake friends who promise a lot and deliver little. It’s saying “actions speak louder than words” or, in our new knowledge about friendship, “look for costly signals.” Good advice, no doubt. We know the importance of time and vulnerability.</p>
<p class="in_para">But I think we can learn a lot about human nature by the fact that most people didn’t read it that way. What was the most common thing people said about friends in surveys? “A friend is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110" title="110"></span>there for you.” And the popular interpretation of the maxim emphasizes the same. Costly signals are good, but I think people resisted the first notion because we just don’t want to keep score. (And maybe the scholarly interpretation feels we need a bit of a reminder there because people do exploit us at times. Fair point.)</p>
<p class="in_para">Roy Baumeister at Florida State University reports that studies unanimously show we judge the quality of our friendships based on “availability of support”: <i class="calibre4">Are you there for me when I need you?</i> But as for “deeds,” the concrete assistance people can provide, the research is mixed, sometimes even negative. Once someone is a friend, we don’t want to think as much about deeds. We don’t want to keep score. That gets transactional real fast. It’s a slippery slope to ditching those who care but can offer the least and currying favor with those who can give the most but don’t care at all.</p>
<p class="in_para">We’re much more focused on feelings and intentions. And those matter. Is there a difference between a fifty-dollar gift and a fifty-dollar bribe? Between murder and self-defense? Of course. But the difference isn’t in the deed itself, it’s in the intentions.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now the cynical might wonder what would happen if all we think about is feelings and never get any concrete aid when we need it: we’d be screwed. No need to worry there. Society didn’t get this big because people don’t default to cooperation. As we saw, we’re wired for help. And we’re more likely to do it when the stakes are the highest. When friends are in need, we’re more likely to help—even when it’s not rational and even in the most unlikely of circumstances.</p>
<p class="in_para">Would you lie for a friend? Let’s raise the stakes: Would you lie to the <i class="calibre4">government</i> for a friend? Researchers asked thirty thousand people from over thirty countries if they would lie under oath to protect a pal. Was the propensity to help consistent around the world, all of us bound by a single version of human nature? Heck, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111" title="111"></span>no. Results varied widely by country. The data were all over the place. But then they found the pattern . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Anthropologist Daniel Hruschka, who led the study, sorted the data by whether the countries were fair, whether they were stable, whether they were corrupt. Plain and simple: where life was harder, people were more likely to put themselves at risk to protect their pal. Where friends were most in need, people were friends “indeed” and “in deed.”</p>
<p class="in_para">So what’s the final verdict on the maxim? We’re gonna go with: true . . . but with an asterisk, because we need to clear up that confusion about the interpretation. We gotta get rid of that clever rhyme and clarify the “in deed” versus “indeed” distinction. In the future, let’s say:</p>
<p class="in_para"><i class="calibre4">“A friend who is there for you when you’re in need is definitely a friend.”</i></p>
<p class="in_para">Far clunkier, I know, but I promised you science, not sound bites. And that does clarify what we all want. Be there for me when I need you. The world may be selfish and competitive, but you and I do not have to be. Maybe you can or can’t help with “deeds,” but I’m not just looking for transactional gain: most of all I’m looking for “another self” to help me shoulder the burden of life.</p>
<p class="in_para">There’s one key thing the maxim doesn’t cover that I think is important to remember: friendship deserves a little more respect even when no one is in need. With no institutional backing, friendship gets no equivalent of a wedding anniversary, a family reunion, or a note of appreciation for ten years with the company. Friendship does the heavy lifting of happiness in our lives, so I’d say it deserves better. Time is critical, vulnerability is essential, but maybe something else we should remember is gratitude. Hug a friend today. We don’t celebrate our friendships enough.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112" title="112"></span>While writing this book, I was dealing with some friendship issues myself. Writing this section helped me, and I agree with the conclusions we have come to. (I would be even more vulnerable with my feelings here, but we both know it would make me more susceptible to witchcraft. That said, please rest assured I consider you a friend and would enjoy eating your intestines.) Oh, one more thing before we close out the section:</p>
<p class="in_para">RIP, George Price. I hope we did you justice.</p>
<p class="in_para">Okey-dokey. Now that we’ve plumbed the depths of friendship, it’s time to raise the stakes again and dive even deeper into the mysteries of our crazy, crazy relationships. And what is crazier than love? Nothing I can think of. Now romance is a big, big, BIG subject, but we’re going to focus on that perennial question about love: Does it conquer all?</p>
<p class="in_para">Time to find out . . .</p>
