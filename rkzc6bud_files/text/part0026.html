<h2 class="chap_num" id="ch18"><span class="right_" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210" title="210"></span><a href="part0003.html#rch18" class="calibre3">18</a></h2>
<p class="non_para">It all started with a Persian rug. The patient brought it as a gift for Ted Kaptchuk because he had “cured” her. Ted accepted it gracefully . . . despite not believing a word she said. He wasn’t a surgeon or an oncologist, he wasn’t even an MD. Ted dispensed herbs and acupuncture.</p>
<p class="in_para">Ted’s a sincere and reasonable guy. He believed his work had <i class="calibre4">some</i> ability to make his patients feel better; that’s why he did it. But this woman was saying he had cured a problem with her ovaries that required surgery. As he told the <i class="calibre4">New Yorker</i>, “There was no fucking way needles or herbs did anything for that woman’s ovaries. It had to be some kind of placebo, but I had never given the idea of a placebo effect much attention.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Years later he was invited to visit Harvard Medical School. Researchers were exploring potential new therapies based on alternative medicine and wanted his insight. And this is where he first got some formal exposure to the placebo effect. Often, the effect was so strong that it was more powerful than the drug being tested. This made doctors angry because it got in the way. Ted was confused. <i class="calibre4">We’re trying to relieve pain and this relieves pain. Why would you hate it?</i></p>
<p class="in_para">And that’s when Ted knew what he would spend the rest of his career doing. He wanted to help patients by understanding this “nuisance” that brought so many people relief. Ted would remark, “We were struggling to increase drug effects while no one was trying to increase the placebo effect.” He thought we were ignoring one of the most powerful tools in medicine. So Ted devoted himself to showing doctors the error they had been making.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211" title="211"></span>And that was not going to be easy. He was going to have to prove this scientifically, or no one would listen to him. He didn’t have an MD or a PhD. He knew nothing about conducting clinical studies or the statistical methods necessary for research. So he would have to learn . . .</p>
<p class="in_para"><span class="make_smallcaps">CUE THE ROCKY THEME</span>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Ted asked the top medical statisticians at Harvard to take him under their wing and teach him. It was absurdly difficult to go from herbs and acupuncture needles to rigorous math, but he was dedicated. Ted worked hard. And that hard work paid off when he was able to start leading studies—and especially once he started seeing the results. He wasn’t crazy. The placebo effect couldn’t kill viruses or excise tumors, but it had incredible power to make “real” medicine even better.</p>
<p class="in_para">He split migraine patients into three groups. The first received a placebo in an envelope labeled “Maxalt” (an FDA-approved migraine drug). The second got real Maxalt in an envelope labeled “placebo.” The third got Maxalt in an envelope labeled “Maxalt.” What was the result? Thirty percent of those receiving the placebo labeled “Maxalt” felt better. And 38 percent of the ones who got the real drug labeled “placebo” got relief. Statistically, the results were indistinguishable. The placebo was as powerful as the drug in relieving pain. But that wasn’t the most important insight. The ones who got Maxalt labeled “Maxalt” felt better 62 percent of the time. <i class="calibre4">That’s 24 percent better than the same exact medication when it’s labeled differently.</i> To get maximum effectiveness, you needed to maximize the placebo effect.</p>
<p class="in_para">And he even learned how his previous work had helped people. Ted took two groups of patients and gave one real acupuncture and the second “sham” acupuncture (seems the same to subjects but the needles don’t penetrate the body). Both reported similar <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212" title="212"></span>improvements. So Ted’s acupuncture didn’t “really” provide any relief—but the placebo effect did.</p>
<p class="in_para">Of course, Ted’s research met with resistance. But now he could hit back with rigorous research. He made it very clear he wasn’t saying the placebo effect was going to cure cancer or fix broken bones. But Ted could now prove placebos had legit physiological effects on patients when it came to pain and anxiety, and boosting the results of “real” treatments.</p>
<p class="in_para">Ted showed it wasn’t magic and it wasn’t fake. Naloxone is a drug that blocks opiate receptors, usually used to counteract heroin overdoses. But Naloxone also blocks the body’s natural opiates, endorphins. Guess what else happens when you give Naloxone to people? <i class="calibre4">The placebo effect stops working.</i> So placebos aren’t multidimensional-quantum-crystal-healing-magic: they’re a normal process that leverages the body’s natural painkillers in some way that modern medicine did not yet understand. And that effect could be profound. Eight milligrams of morphine is a lot. But patients who receive it and patients who are merely told they received it experience the same amount of relief. You have to up the dosage by 50 percent to get the drug’s effect to surpass that of a placebo.</p>
<p class="in_para">It wasn’t long before the no-MD guy with a degree from a Macao Chinese medicine program was receiving grants from the NIH to further his research. But what was troubling Ted now was though he knew the placebo effect was real and useful, he wasn’t sure just how and why it worked. And he was finding some strange results in the data that told him the rabbit hole went even deeper than he thought . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Four placebo pills a day work better than two. Blue placebo pills are superior at improving sleep; you’ll want green placebo pills for reducing anxiety. But placebo capsules beat placebo pills—and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213" title="213"></span>placebo injections were even better. Oh, and expensive, brandname placebos beat cheap generic ones. <i class="calibre4">Huh?</i> Why would the method of administration make such a difference when the (inactive) substance delivered was always the same? And the craziest result of all? Placebos even worked when they were “open label” placebos—yes, you could tell people that the fake medication was fake and they’d <i class="calibre4">still</i> feel better.</p>
<p class="in_para">And that’s when he realized why he had been such a good healer even when dispensing alternative medicine treatments. The placebo effect was about the ritual. It was about the patient’s belief that they would get better. Injections look more serious than pills, so they increase the placebo effect. Brand-names and big price tags scream legitimacy, ergo, more placebo effect. But it wasn’t all about deception. More empathy, more attention, and more concern from a doctor conveyed the same power. One of his studies showed that 28 percent of patients given no treatment had symptomatic relief after three weeks. They got better on their own. But 44 percent of patients given sham acupuncture with a doctor who was “business-like” improved. The ritual and attention had a positive effect. But what happened when the sham acupuncture was combined with a doctor who really showed concern? When the physicians were instructed to have a forty-five-minute conversation with the patient? Sixty-two percent of the patients felt better. Caring had a dose-dependent effect.</p>
<p class="in_para">Again, this isn’t going to kill the Ebola virus or replace bypass surgery. But then again, how often are we going to the doctor for those serious things versus little stuff where we just want less discomfort? And “real” medicine works even better with the placebo effect. But what that means is “real” medicine works better when someone shows us they care.</p>
<p class="in_para">Ted Kaptchuk proved that while we have certainly gained <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214" title="214"></span>enormously from improvements in technology, we also lost something along the way by ignoring the power of compassion. Rushed doctor visits reduce the placebo effect and reduce patient recovery. We pay lip service to bedside manner, but it has real effects on patients. Of course, we want real drugs and real surgery with “real” effects. But they work so much better—scientifically better—<i class="calibre4">with</i> the human element that delivers those “fake” placebo effects.</p>
<p class="in_para">Ted Kaptchuk hasn’t practiced acupuncture in over twenty years. But he has been applying the lessons he learned back in those days in his new role. In 2013 Ted was appointed to full professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He still doesn’t have an MD or PhD. He leads the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter at Harvard. It’s the only program in existence dedicated to the placebo effect, the human side of medical science.</p>
<p class="in_para">So that’s Ted’s story . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But we’re not done yet. We still haven’t explained why the placebo effect works. Yeah, yeah, doctor-relationship-heals-you-blah-blah is nice and poetic and pretty perfect for my book, but we’re not here just for feel-good stories. If our body can just turn off the pain, why doesn’t it? What’s the evolutionary logic behind why those warm feelings can sometimes matter as much as “real” treatment?</p>
<p class="in_para">Think of pain not as a direct effect of injury but more like the “<span class="make_smallcaps">NEEDS SERVICE</span>” light on your car dashboard. It tells you something is wrong and needs addressing. Your body is saying: <i class="calibre4">You need to stop what you’re doing and take care of this.</i> Care. As we saw, it’s central to the placebo effect. It’s why placebos work even when we know they’re placebos. When someone cares for us, the more attention they give us, the more competent they seem, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215" title="215"></span>better tools they use, the more time they spend with us, the more our bodies notice. And then your body can tell you a new story: <i class="calibre4">Someone is caring for us. I don’t need to shout at you with pain anymore. We’re safe now.</i> And it turns the “<span class="make_smallcaps">NEEDS SERVICE</span>” light off.</p>
<p class="in_para">Loneliness heightens our attention to negative emotions because you’re not safe, you have no one looking out for you, and your body knows that historically this has been mucho bad for Homo sapiens. The placebo effect is the reverse. It says, <i class="calibre4">Someone is looking out for us. Backup has arrived. We are safe now.</i> Up to 66 percent of therapy clients say they felt better before they even had their first appointment, just as a result of an intake interview. <i class="calibre4">Help is on the way. I can turn the light off.</i> Caring can heal you. Usually when I hear fluffy sentences like that, my eyes start to uncontrollably roll upward, but it’s true, scientifically.</p>
<p class="in_para">It turns out placebos do have an active ingredient: human beings caring for one another.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">So what happens in a world so focused on status and the extrinsic and so little on care and the intrinsic? We become depressed. Happiness levels have declined in the Western world over the past fifty years and the incidence of major depression is up, despite our enormous material success. In 2011 the National Center for Health Statistics announced that nearly a quarter of middle-aged women in the US are currently on antidepressants.</p>
<p class="in_para">But today we get the causes of depression all wrong. We’re quick to think it’s due to a chemical imbalance or some other endogenous reason. That’s definitely part of it but far from the biggest cause. Psychologists George Brown and Tirril Harris did a series of studies showing that 20 percent of women who did <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216" title="216"></span><i class="calibre4">not</i> experience depression had major problems in their lives. For women who did become depressed, the number was 68 percent. Yeah, I know, the only surprise about that stat is nothing. Life problems make you sad. But here’s the twist: it wasn’t just the amount of bad stuff that led to depression; it was the ratio of problems to stabilizers in your life—how much support you received from those around you. Big problems and no support? The chance of depression hit 75 percent. Johann Hari covered the results of the research in his book <i class="calibre4">Lost Connections</i>: “[Depression] wasn’t just a problem caused by the brain going wrong. It was caused by life going wrong.” And these effects have been replicated around the world.</p>
<p class="in_para">A 2012 study on depression concluded, “General and specific characteristics of modernization correlate with higher risk.” Another study, “Depression and Modernization: A Cross-Cultural Study of Women,” found that rural Nigerian women, who materially have it the worst, were the least likely to be depressed, while US women in cities were the most likely to be. The Western world is richer than ever but more depressed than ever. Since problems in life are inevitable, it’s clearly an issue of support. We’re not getting it the way we’re living.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what did we do about it? Oh, we gave them a placebo. Yes, I’m talking about antidepressants like Prozac. A 2014 paper concluded: “Analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect.” And another study, titled “Listening to Prozac but Hearing Placebo,” looked at over 2,300 subjects and found “approximately one quarter of the drug response is due to the administration of an active medication, one half is a placebo effect, and the remaining quarter is due to other nonspecific factors.” Did these papers result in a torrent of pushback from the scientific community at large? Nope.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217" title="217"></span>I’m not saying everyone should toss their meds in the trash. They do help people. But for many, it’s not because of the reasons we thought. The biggest explanation for their effects is that they simulate care. Care we’re lacking in the modern world. But what happens when someone doesn’t get the placebo? Or when the placebo effect isn’t enough? Well, they address the lack of a feeling of care more directly. With illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="in_para">We all know the story of the lab rat feverishly pressing the lever to get more drugs. Bruce Alexander, professor of psychology at Simon Fraser University, wondered if addiction was the only cause. He realized that in all those experiments, the rodent junkie was <i class="calibre4">alone</i>. What happens when you put rats in a cage with friends and toys and create a rat-topia? They don’t want the drug. When alone, rats used 25 mg of morphine. In rat-topia, the animals used under 5 mg. Of course the original rats used drugs, they were in solitary confinement.</p>
<p class="in_para">In the paper “Is Social Attachment an Addictive Disorder?”, neuroscientist Thomas Insel’s conclusion was: yup, our brains are addicted to other people. And substance abuse mimics the results in our gray matter, leveraging the same dopaminergic pathways. Remember how Naloxone, the opiate blocker, killed the placebo effect? It also knocks out the bonding effects of religious rituals. When we’re in a community, we get high on our own supply, but when there is no community, we must get our supply elsewhere.</p>
<p class="in_para">Between 1980 and 2011, morphine usage increased by a factor of thirty. But it didn’t increase everywhere. Sam Quinones notes, “Use didn’t rise in the developing world, which might reasonably be viewed as the region in most acute pain. Instead, the wealthiest countries, with 20 percent of the world’s population, came to consume almost all—more than 90 percent—of the world’s morphine.” In a land of individualism, focused on status and control <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" title="218"></span>but with little care, we see an explosion of mental health problems and addiction.</p>
<p class="in_para">So let’s consider the opposite. What happens in a world where individualism is not at the forefront? Where status and extrinsic values aren’t just secondary, they’re temporarily gone? Heck, I’ll up the ante. What happens when we experience war and disaster? When things are about as objectively awful as they can be?</p>
<p class="in_para">The answer is, we revert to human nature. Maybe you think that’s a bad thing, especially after all the awfulness I’ve described about our current situation. Maybe you think human nature is all Darwinian cruelty. To be fair, thus far I’ve sometimes given Darwin a bad rap. Survival of the fittest, ruthless competition, modern individualism, and the story of poor George Price. But that’s not the full story of our evolution.</p>
<p class="in_para">Why do you think we’re the Big Kahuna of species on this planet? Because we were the smartest? We weren’t. Neanderthals were. Your brain is 15 percent smaller than theirs. Recent discoveries show they had fire and music and culture and cave paintings. Heck, it’s looking like we Homo sapiens learned a few things from them, like using tools. So why did we win?</p>
<p class="in_para">We became the Grand Poobah of life on Earth because we were the most cooperative. That’s the story of our species’ success. Rutger Bregman says, “If Neanderthals were a super-fast computer, we were an old-fashioned PC—with wi-fi. We were slower, but better connected.”</p>
<p class="in_para">As I discussed in the first section, we’re terrible at detecting lies. But our lie detection weakness is our collective strength. Our default is to trust one another. To work together. When individual Neanderthals said, “Screw this, I’m outta here,” we stuck together. Our ability to collaborate, to help, even when things were at their worst, meant, over time, we won and they lost. Despite <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219" title="219"></span>their bigger brains, Neanderthals could work together only in tribes of ten to fifteen, but our collaborative superpowers allowed us to scale to bands of over a hundred. You can imagine how those battles went. And a closer reading of Darwin shows he wasn’t ignorant of this: “Those communities, which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members, would flourish best and rear the greatest number of offspring.”</p>
<p class="in_para">We tend to believe that when things are at their objective worst, like during war and disaster, humans go all “every man for himself”—but that’s just not the case. Sociologist Charles Fritz did a study in 1959 interviewing over nine thousand survivors of disaster, and he found that when modern society goes to hell, we return to our natural state of cooperation. Status is temporarily put aside. We ignore squabbles over politics, class, and religion. No time for that stuff right now, grab a bucket. We gain clarity over what is truly important, a clarity that seems impossible during day-to-day life. When the stakes are life and death, what’s meaningful is stark.</p>
<p class="in_para">When you have a problem, it’s your problem. But when we all have a problem, like tsunami devastation or enemy invasion, it’s <i class="calibre4">our</i> problem. We’re in it together. Fritz wrote: “The widespread sharing of danger, loss, and deprivation produces an intimate, primarily group solidarity among the survivors . . . This merging of individual and societal needs provides a feeling of belonging and a sense of unity rarely achieved under normal circumstances.” And so we revert to our nature. The need for connection is wired deeper than the desire for comfort. And when things are at their objective worst, humans are at their best.</p>
<p class="in_para">In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. Eighty percent of the city was flooded, over 1,800 people died. How did humans respond? Well, the news was filled with reports of lawlessness. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220" title="220"></span>Murder, rapes, looting, and gang dominance filled the headlines. But it just wasn’t true. The next month a deeper analysis revealed that “the vast majority of reported atrocities committed by evacuees—mass murders, rapes, and beatings—have turned out to be false, or at least unsupported by any evidence, according to key military, law-enforcement, medical, and civilian officials in positions to know.” Rebecca Solnit spoke with Denise Moore, who was there in the midst of it all, and she said, “We were trapped like animals, but I saw the greatest humanity I’d ever seen from the most unlikely places.”</p>
<p class="in_para">The Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware reviewed over seven hundred studies on similar incidents and found this type of response is true in general. We don’t exploit, we unite. Bregman quotes one researcher as saying, “Whatever the extent of the looting, it always pales in significance to the widespread altruism that leads to free and massive giving and sharing of goods and services.”</p>
<p class="in_para">When the group is threatened, we sacrifice willingly because it’s not sacrifice. We are happy to be needed and to contribute. When disaster strikes, more people head toward the scene than away. Fritz wrote: “Movement toward the disaster area usually is both quantitatively and qualitatively more significant than flight or evacuation from the scene of destruction.” And this is the norm. Adam Mayblum recounted his experience at 9/11 to Rebecca Solnit: “They failed in terrorizing us. We were calm. If you want to kill us, leave us alone because we will do it by ourselves. If you want to make us stronger, attack and we unite.”</p>
<p class="in_para">When we are one, we don’t need placebos. We give care and are provided with care. During war, psychiatric admissions decline. This phenomenon has been documented time and time <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" title="221"></span>again. When Belfast experienced riots in the 1960s, depression plummeted in the districts with the most violence and went up where there was none. Psychologist H. A. Lyons wrote, “It would be irresponsible to suggest violence as a means of improving mental health, but the Belfast findings suggest that people will feel better psychologically if they have more involvement with their community.”</p>
<p class="in_para">And, perhaps most shockingly, we are often happy. Famed humanitarian Dorothy Day wrote about San Francisco’s 1906 earthquake saying, “What I remember most plainly about the earthquake was the human warmth and kindliness of everyone afterward . . . While the crisis lasted, people loved each other.”</p>
<p class="in_para">And when the threat is quelled, ironically, we miss it. Not the pain or the misery, but the community. Sebastian Junger spoke to journalist Nidzara Ahmetasevic, twenty years after Sarajevo’s war, asking her if they were happier then. She replied, “We were the <i class="calibre4">happiest</i>. And we laughed more.” She went on to add, “I do miss something about the war. But I also believe that the world we are living in—and the peace we have—is very fucked up if somebody is missing war. And many people do.”</p>
<p class="in_para">No, I’m not suggesting we go to war or all live in grass huts with no electricity. Obviously, there are many, many, <i class="calibre4">many</i> great things about the modern world, and I don’t mean to come off as some alchemist of melancholy making modernity seem like an air-conditioned nightmare. But James Branch Cabell wrote, “An optimist believes we live in the best possible of worlds. A pessimist fears that this is true.” There is little doubt that when it comes to community and happiness, we are, in some ways, victims of our own success. It’s easy to notice the benefits of modern life, but so much harder to calculate the loss of meaning and community.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222" title="222"></span>Early human life was routinely a disaster, and we could not survive without help. Individualism was not even on the menu. There are a near-infinite number of reasons to want to put that behind us. We no longer have to depend on each other, but we are still wired to. We need each other, even when we don’t <i class="calibre4">need</i> each other. If all of your child’s needs were provided for, you would still want to do things for them, to protect them despite the fact that they’re safe, to feed them though food is plentiful. If your kid had everything they could ever want, you would still desire to perform the process of caretaking. As a culture, we seem to believe we can “solve” all the needs and get to zero, but we still need to be needed. Junger wrote, “Humans don’t mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it; what they mind is not feeling necessary. Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel necessary.” It took a global pandemic for many of us to be reminded how important our relationships are.</p>
<p class="in_para">We have grown smarter, but less wise. And that’s not just a warm platitude, it’s science. Wisdom isn’t just raw IQ; it involves understanding others. And when researchers surveyed two thousand Americans from different income levels, they found wealthier meant less wise. No, money’s not bad. But the poor have to depend on one another more, like we did in the past, like we do during disaster. And that’s what the scientists found: “The effect of social class on wise reasoning was at least in part accounted for by a greater sense of interdependence expressed by participants with lower [socioeconomic status].”</p>
<p class="in_para">Remember how friends were “another self”? Communities are the same. The self-expansion research found the same effect for groups. We include them as part of ourselves when we belong. Communities are another self, another friend. In fact, the effect is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223" title="223"></span>stronger in some ways: a 2020 study found that we feel the most support from friends when they’re connected to one another. Feeling loved by five separate pals is less loving than five mutual pals. Friends are great. Communities can be even better.</p>
<p class="in_para">We may giggle at the Amish, but they know this better than we do. They don’t eschew technology because they’re Luddites. They do adopt some of it, like tractors. How do they decide what gets approved and what doesn’t? By the effect it has on the closeness of the community. Tractors help you grow crops. Sounds good. But cars let people live farther apart. No bueno.</p>
<p class="in_para">When Amish youth come of age, they participate in what is called “Rumspringa.” They don’t have to follow the rules and can live in the modern world for a while. They get a chance to see the other side. After a couple of years of this, they have to choose: modern world or Amish world? More than 80 percent choose to return and become Amish. And since the 1950s, the percentage that chooses Amish life has only been increasing.</p>
<p class="in_para">It’s not enough to merely have face-to-face contact. We need a community. Remember those health benefits of human contact? Psychologist Julianne Holt-Lunstad reviewed 148 longitudinal studies and found that people who were enmeshed in a community had a 50 percent lower chance of death over a seven-year stretch. But that community aspect is paramount. Employees and digital connections had no effect. You lived longer only by spending time with those you really knew and felt close to.</p>
<p class="in_para">With community comes obligation. But we need the burden, as we need the responsibilities of parenthood. We have gone a little too far in the way of freedom. We want a two-way street because too much control is unfulfilling. We need to share and be cared for, just as we need to care for others. Look at a list of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224" title="224"></span>happiest careers and it’s dominated by helping: clergy, firefighters, physical therapists, teachers. (Authors are up there as well, much to the surprise of yours truly.)</p>
<p class="in_para">I don’t raise all these depressing points about modern life to make you sad. I want you to be happier. But Johann Hari points to research showing if you try to be happier, you will likely fail. Why? Because the Western definition of happiness is individualistic. And, as Brett Ford of UC Berkeley found, that doesn’t work. Your efforts will be all me-me-me, and we saw that doesn’t jive with millions of years of human nature. You’ll be going at it all wrong because you’re aiming for the wrong target. More status, more money, more control, fewer obligations won’t do it . . . Oh, by the way, if you live in Asia, ignore what I just said. There, the definition of happiness is more collectivist. To be happier, you’ll try to help others and your efforts will be more successful. As Ford told Hari, “The more you think happiness is a social thing, the better off you are.” You can get happier. But to rise, you must first think of how to lift others.</p>
<p class="in_para">Hopefully, it’s all starting to come together like Voltron. It’s almost time to wrap this up. We need to get the final word on whether we’re islands or not. But before we do that, maybe we should look at a real island and see what it can tell us about the story of our species . . .</p>
