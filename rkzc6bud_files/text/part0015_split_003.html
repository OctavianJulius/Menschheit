<h2 class="chap_head" id="calibre_pb_3">3. EMPHASIZE COMMUNITY</h2>
<p class="in_paral">Just like similarity, this method is actually more powerful with narcissists than regular people. Researchers analogized it to alcohol: if you’re not a regular drinker, booze has a bigger effect. And your narcissist isn’t accustomed to empathy, so when it hits, it can hit a lot harder. Remind them about family, friendship, and the connections you have. Their default setting isn’t empathy, so you just need to kick that back into gear. And if you get a positive response with any of these, take a lesson from dog training: positive reinforcement. Reward them for it.</p>
<p class="non_para_ts">They’re not going to change in one big moment of Freudian realization. This isn’t a Disney film, and giving the Grinch a big hug isn’t going to instantly turn him into a sweetheart. This can be a painstaking, thankless process, but for someone you care about, it can be worth it.</p>
<p class="in_para">It helps to remember they’re suffering. Rarely seems like it, but they are. Being an addict to your dreams is a curse. Narcissism is “highly comorbid with other disorders,” which is a fancy way of saying these people have more issues than <i class="calibre4">Vogue</i>. They suffer from higher rates of depression, anxiety, chronic envy, perfectionism, relationship difficulties, and last, but certainly not least, suicide. When people suffer from depression, anxiety, or borderline personality disorder, we tend to feel sympathy, but with narcissism <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101" title="101"></span>we often say they’re just “bad.” That’s like feeling sorry for people with tuberculosis but saying those with meningitis are a bunch of jerks. Narcissism shows a heritability of 45–80 percent, with at least two studies pointing to genetic underpinnings. No, your frenemy is not nice. But it’s important to remember it may not be their fault.</p>
<p class="in_para">But what do you do if they <i class="calibre4">are</i> clinical level and you can’t <span class="make_smallcaps">MEEP</span>-<span class="make_smallcaps">MEEP</span>? The final option is the two Bs: boundaries and bargaining. Basically, you need to aim for the opposite of “another self”—a totally transactional relationship. First, establish boundaries. What will you no longer tolerate? And what will you do if they violate those boundaries? Be firm and consistent but not mean. Next is bargaining. It’s <i class="calibre4">Let’s Make a Deal</i> time. (Ignore that smell of brimstone.) Focus on win-win. Narcissists will often play ball if you have something they want. Make sure they pay in advance and always price above market. Judge actions, not intentions. A final good move that clinical psychologist Albert Bernstein recommends when they’re angling for something dishonest is to ask, “What will people think?” They may not feel guilt, but they do feel shame, and narcissists are very concerned about appearances.</p>
<p class="in_para">The good news is that if you’re friends for the long haul, narcissists do tend to soften with age. Over the years, reality hammers at their story, those comorbidities mount, or the abused they have left in their wake realize there’s a sale on pitchforks and torches at Wal-Mart. I don’t want to invoke the idea of karma here, but very often they get their due. Few can sustain their illusions at the same level forever.</p>
<p class="in_para">The irony is that narcissists are so full of themselves yet lack self-awareness. Case in point: Tania Singer was a big-deal academic who bullied everyone around her, even the pregnant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102" title="102"></span>women in her lab. But eventually her reputation caught up with her. What did Tania Singer study? She was the leading researcher on <i class="calibre4">empathy</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Alright, we’ve covered frenemies. It’s almost time to round it all up and get our final verdict on the “friend in need” maxim. But first we need to see just how extreme the power of friendship can be . . .</p>
