<p class="non_para">Despite playing professional soccer for over twenty years, Carlos Kaiser never scored a single goal. In fact, during those two decades he appeared in only thirty games. Carlos Kaiser was not a very good soccer player. But that wasn’t a problem. Because Carlos Kaiser was an excellent liar.</p>
<p class="in_para">He played for some of the best teams in the world, including Botafogo and Fluminense. He made big money, partied with celebrities, and was surrounded by beautiful women. What he didn’t do was <i class="calibre4">actually play soccer</i>. His nickname among the other players was “171.” Why? Because that’s the penal number for con artists in Brazilian prisons.</p>
<p class="in_para">He was born Carlos Henrique Raposo in Brazil on April 2, 1963. He was poor but had big dreams. As he said in an interview, “I knew that the best way to make it happen was through soccer. I wanted to be a soccer player without having to actually play it.” Honestly, he wasn’t bad at the sport. By age ten he got an agent, and at sixteen he signed with Puebla, a top team in Mexico. There was only one problem: “I didn’t want to play.” Most young players were eager to get out there and show they had the goods. Kaiser was the exact opposite, doing anything and everything to avoid the ball.</p>
<p class="in_para">But how do you keep this up for <i class="calibre4">two decades</i>? Kaiser developed a system. First, befriend all the top players. Kaiser may not have liked playing soccer, but he loved nightclubs. And he had connections at all the hottest spots in Brazil. Knowing Kaiser meant VIP status, free drinks, and pretty girls for soccer stars.</p>
<p class="in_para">Next, you get them to vouch for you. His soccer résumé wasn’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43" title="43"></span>stellar, but it showed that he had some legitimate talent. So, at his behest, the team stars would nag their coach, and before long, Kaiser would get signed to a short-term “trial” contract. That’s all he needed. The Trojan horse was now inside the city walls.</p>
<p class="in_para">Officially a player, Kaiser would say he needed time to get back into shape. That would get him a few months where he could make money and have fun with no pressure to do that thing he hated, playing soccer. Eventually, he would have to touch a ball. He’d confidently trot out onto the practice field, wind up for a big kick—and immediately collapse, wailing in pain and clutching his thigh. Nobody could fake an injury like Kaiser. He’d give Oscar-worthy performances. And in the era before MRIs, coaches would have to take his word for it, the team’s star players all taking his side. And so he’d collect checks for a few more months.</p>
<p class="in_para">Meanwhile, Kaiser was living the life. Nonstop partying. (Oddly, his injuries never seemed to affect his dancing ability.) The other players knew he was a con man. They knew he couldn’t play at their level. But they loved him. He was a charmer. He made sure they always had fun. (And it didn’t hurt that he always seemed to be able to introduce them to the prettiest girls in every city they visited.) So when coaches would start to get wise to Kaiser’s perpetual injuries, the team stars would rush to his defense.</p>
<p class="in_para">Of course, he couldn’t do this forever. Which was not a problem. He would just move to another team. In the pre-internet era it wasn’t easy to get stats on a player. Games from one country were rarely televised in other countries. Much of soccer recruiting worked by word of mouth. And with his teammate-pleasing ways, it wasn’t hard to get stars to vouch for him at another club. Soon he had a trial contract, and he’d repeat the whole cycle . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Now that’s not to say sustaining his scam was easy. Over twenty years there were plenty of close calls. One time he had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44" title="44"></span>already worn out the injury scam, and the team was scheduled to do its first public training session. With all the most beloved members of the team singing his praises, fans were eagerly anticipating a glimpse of what he could do on the field. And this was an utter nightmare for Kaiser. So as all eyes fell on him, he suddenly began kicking soccer balls into the stands. Fans went wild, grasping for them. But Kaiser didn’t stop. He kicked <i class="calibre4">all</i> the team’s soccer balls into the stands. They had nothing to practice with. The team just did running drills and calisthenics for the remaining time, nothing that would expose the faker among them.</p>
<p class="in_para">And he didn’t just use his teammates to his advantage: he leveraged anyone he could. He turned on the charm with the journalists and made sure they got the star interviews they so desperately needed. So a player who never played ended up getting a surprising amount of coverage, and it was almost always positive. When the team did publicity matches with youth leagues, he’d slip them cash to be overly aggressive so he could fake another injury. When the owner visited, spectators would be bribed to scream his name. Rinse and repeat until it was time to move on to a new club . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">He kept this scam up for over twenty years, playing, on average, just over one game a year. The lies never stopped. His grandmother died at least four times. He produced a sick note from a dentist saying his teeth had caused a leg injury. Kaiser joked, “All the teams I joined celebrated twice—when I signed and then when I left.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Until the one day our charlatan faced the greatest challenge of his so-called career. He had signed with the Brazilian soccer club Bangu, and in typical Kaiser style he already had the press raving about his goal scoring despite the fact he had never scored a goal. Anywhere. Ever. Headlines read, “<span class="make_smallcaps">BANGU HAS ITS KING</span>.” And <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45" title="45"></span>Kaiser being Kaiser, he was showing that newspaper to everyone who would listen. Fans were dying to see him on the field. Unfortunately, so was the team’s owner.</p>
<p class="in_para">Castor de Andrade was not your typical soccer club owner. He was not a titan of business who had purchased a team as a bauble. Castor was a mobster, frequently referred to as “the most dangerous man in Brazil.” It’s certainly not unheard of for team owners to get into heated disputes with referees—but Castor would do this with a gun visible in his back pocket.</p>
<p class="in_para">A teammate mentioned to Kaiser that despite being “injured,” he was on the roster for the big game tomorrow. This, combined with the fact that it was 4 <span class="make_smallcaps">A</span>.<span class="make_smallcaps">M</span>. and Kaiser was still partying at a nightclub, scared the hell out of him. The next day the coach told him not to worry, they wouldn’t make anyone with an injury play. But as the game progressed, it was clear they were in trouble. Down 2–0, Castor himself was insisting that his new star player get out on the field with that magic scoring ability the newspapers wouldn’t shut up about.</p>
<p class="in_para">For the first time in many years, Kaiser was not afraid of being exposed . . . He was afraid of being <i class="calibre4">murdered</i>. Kaiser walked out to the field, trembling. It was made worse by opposing fans hurling insults at him from the stands. But then he had an idea . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">He screamed back at them. Kaiser leapt into the crowd, calling them words my publisher has most likely already edited from this book. In response, the ref threw a red card, ejecting Kaiser from the game. Back in the locker room his teammates laughed that he may not have had to play, but that wasn’t going to stop Castor. Kaiser’s trickery has finally caught up to him. And as de Andrade entered the room, everything went silent. The club boss was incensed. But before he could even get a word out, Kaiser cut him off. Kaiser said that God took both his parents away when he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46" title="46"></span>was a child, but God was kind enough to give him a new father—Castor. The other team’s fans had been calling his new father a crook and a thief. Kaiser said he could not stand by and watch that happen, so he let loose on them. He had to defend his new father’s honor. And Castor’s response to hearing this story was just as swift . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">He doubled Kaiser’s salary and extended his contract for six more months.</p>
<p class="in_para">I’m telling you this story now, so obviously word got out that Kaiser was a con man. Was he then shamed? Sued? Ostracized? Punished in any way? Nope. He became more famous than ever. Unlike many legitimate soccer stars of that era who are long forgotten, his story of manipulation and deceit still routinely gets told. He’s more famous as a liar than he ever was as a player.</p>
<p class="in_para">Is there <i class="calibre4">any</i> way to really get the truth out of some people?</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">When told to rank a list of 555 personality traits, college students put “being a liar” dead last. Which is funny because the average college student lies in about a third of conversations. For adults, it’s one in five. Let’s not even get into online dating, where 81 percent of profiles deviate from the truth. Most of our fibs are white lies, but Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire says you tell about two whoppers a day. Whom do you lie to most frequently? Mom. You lie to your spouse the least (one in every ten conversations)—but you tell them the biggest lies. And you’re on the receiving end of about two hundred a day. (This is not one of them, I promise.)</p>
<p class="in_para">And we’re <i class="calibre4">terrible</i> at detecting lies, averaging a 54 percent success rate. Might as well flip a coin. Police aren’t any better, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47" title="47"></span>even though they think they are when surveyed. Yes, some folks are good lie detectors, but you wouldn’t want to be them; they’re people who have had strokes and experienced significant damage to the left lobe of their prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p class="in_para">Humans have been trying to master lie detection for thousands of years—and failing miserably. In the 1920s the first polygraph was developed by a number of people, including William Moulton Marston, who would go on to create the DC Comics character Wonder Woman. And he probably should have stuck to that character’s Lasso of Truth because (at least in the comics) it worked, whereas the polygraph does not. The US National Academy of Sciences has gone on the record, saying that “the Federal government should not rely on polygraph examinations for screening prospective or current employees to identify spies or other national security risks because the test results are too inaccurate.” With as little as fifteen minutes of training, people have been able to consistently beat the test, with the funniest effective method being the well-timed clenching of one’s anus.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what about the police interrogations we see on TV? That’s the Reid technique, developed in the 1940s and first published as a manual by John Reid and Fred Inbau in 1962. It’s an aggressive “third-degree” approach designed to stress a suspect into confessing. Guess what? The Reid technique works. In fact, it works <i class="calibre4">too</i> well. Doesn’t matter if you’re actually guilty or not: it’ll get a confession out of most people. Canada and the UK have both dropped Reid-style interrogation, finding it to be coercive and unethical. And yet this is still the dominant method used by law enforcement in the United States today. As if that weren’t enough, it’s also not scientifically valid. Aldert Vrij, a professor at the University of Portsmouth and a leading expert on lie detection, says the cues it relies on are not predictive. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" title="48"></span>After Reid training, law enforcement officers’ ability to detect deception gets <i class="calibre4">worse</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">So is there any way to reliably detect lies based on <i class="calibre4">real</i> science? Actually, yes. In 2009 the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG) was formed to develop new best practices, and by 2016 they had spent more than fifteen million dollars on over one hundred research projects with top psychologists. I’ve adapted their findings for simplicity’s sake (and because I’m assuming you won’t be able to handcuff someone to a chair). Also, this system takes some time and patience, so it isn’t going to be useful for little lies but can be quite powerful for bigger issues.</p>
<p class="in_para">No, you won’t have to waterboard anyone. The science overwhelmingly recommended a nuanced and sophisticated method humans have never tried in the past five thousand years when attempting to detect lies: <i class="calibre4">being nice</i>. We’ll call our new system <b class="calibre6">The Friendly Journalist Method™</b>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Never be a “bad cop.” Be a “friendly journalist.” You have to get them to like you. To open up. To talk a lot. And to make a mistake that reveals their deception. What’s the first step? Journalists do their homework before they write a piece, and so will you. The more info you have going into a conversation about a suspected lie, the better calibrated your internal lie detector will be. And even more important, some of the most powerful techniques we’ll use later require background info, so we can’t skip this step.</p>
<p class="in_para">And then there’s the “friendly” part. The HIG report found that “bad cop” isn’t effective and “good cop” is. Everybody wants to be treated with respect. And when people are, they’re more likely to talk. Also, never accuse someone of lying. More than one study found that this reduces cooperation. Don’t accuse, be curious.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49" title="49"></span>Do lawyers tell their clients to lie? No. Do they tell them to be honest? No. They tell them to <i class="calibre4">shut up</i>. Well, Friendly Journalist, you want to get them talking as much as possible. Ask lots of open-ended questions that start with “What” or “How,” not things that can be answered with one word. You want to be friendly and say just enough to keep ’em gabbing. Letting them monologue makes them feel in control. They’ll relax. You want them to keep talking so you get more info and can evaluate. Everything they say is another fact to be checked, another story that could be contradicted. And this is exactly why lawyers tell clients to just shut up. You want to do the opposite.</p>
<p class="in_para">If you immediately start challenging what they say, not only might they shut down, but they also might start altering their story. You don’t want to help them tell a better lie. You want them to put it all out there and paint themselves into a corner. Herein lies the problem in dealing with slippery people: they get good feedback, you don’t. If I lie and don’t get caught, I see what works. If I lie and get caught, I see what doesn’t work. On the other hand, the vast majority of the time you don’t get feedback on whether someone was honest with you. So liars are always improving. You aren’t. And that gives them an advantage. Don’t help them improve further.</p>
<p class="in_para">Prior lessons we’ve learned on reading people also apply here. Again, body language is a false god. Here’s our expert Vrij: “No lie-detection tool used to date that is based on analyzing nonverbal and verbal behavior is accurate—far from it.” For the record, let me address a common myth directly: “Liars won’t look you in the eyes.” Wrong-amundo. HIG’s review of the research said, “Gaze aversion has never been shown to be a reliable indicator.” And if that’s not enough to dispel the myth, there’s a 1978 study of the interpersonal behavior of incarcerated psychopaths. Guess <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50" title="50"></span>what? They look people in the eyes <i class="calibre4">more</i> often than nonpsychopaths.</p>
<p class="in_para">Evaluating someone accurately is near impossible if we’re misled by what they’re telling us. But there is a strategy that can get us the truth. While research shows that there is little variance in lie detection ability, there is a <i class="calibre4">lot</i> of variance in the ability to tell lies. So just as with reading people, <b class="calibre6">The Friendly Journalist Method™</b> doesn’t focus on making your lie detection skills better; it focuses on making their lie-telling skills worse. How do we do that?</p>
<p class="in_para">The old polygraph model looked for emotional stress as a sign of lying. That doesn’t work. What does work is applying “cognitive load”—making liars think hard. As Vrij notes, lying well requires a surprising amount of brainpower. Truth tellers merely have to say what they remember. Liars need to know the truth. They also need to generate a plausible story. They need to make sure those don’t contradict. And this model needs to be safely updated in real time as they are asked more questions. Meanwhile, they also need to appear honest, which can require some serious acting. Finally, they must monitor the interviewer’s reactions to make sure that the interviewer is not catching on. This is hard. So we want to make it <i class="calibre4">even harder</i>. The HIG report found increasing cognitive load can boost our measly 54 percent accuracy to as high as 71 percent.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now this is unlikely to make liars just directly confess. What it will do is create a stark contrast between how a truth teller would respond and how a liar would respond. Just like when your computer is chewing on a complex problem, a liar’s performance will slow down and get wonky. And that’s exactly the reaction we’ll be looking for as we apply the techniques. Instead of asking yourself, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51" title="51"></span><i class="calibre4">Is this person lying?</i>, ask yourself, <i class="calibre4">Do they have to think hard?</i> A study by Vrij showed that merely getting police officers to focus on the second question markedly improved their lie detection skills.</p>
<p class="in_para">Okay, we’ve got the fundamentals. You did your homework. You’re playing Friendly Journalist, and they’re gabbing away. You’re keeping an eye out for when they have to think hard. Time to (nicely) smoke out a liar with two powerful techniques from the HIG report.</p>
