<h2 class="chap_num" id="ch14"><span class="right_" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159" title="159"></span><a href="part0003.html#rch14" class="calibre3">14</a></h2>
<p class="non_para">Imagine you wake up tomorrow thinking it’s 1994. In that year you were thirty-one years old, with a partner. You expect <i class="calibre4">Friends</i> to be a brand-new show on TV and <i class="calibre4">The Lion King</i> to be number one at the box office. But, of course, once you get up, the calendar most certainly does not say 1994. You look in the mirror and you’re clearly decades older than thirty-one. Oh, and no more “partner”—now you’re married. (Congrats, by the way.) But you remember nothing that occurred between 1994 and right now. Pretty disorienting, huh?</p>
<p class="in_para">Now imagine this happens <i class="calibre4">every single day</i>. Every morning you start off thinking it’s 1994, remembering nothing that has occurred since then. You have what’s called “anteretrograde amnesia.” No, not what Jason Bourne had. He forgot his past. That’s “retrograde amnesia.” Anteretrograde is when you cannot make new memories, at least none that last for very long. For you, they persist for roughly a day. You move through the world just fine, but nothing sticks until tomorrow. People will say you did this or that, and you’ll have to take their word for it. If you’re reminded of the movie <i class="calibre4">Memento</i>, you’re spot on. And that film has actually been praised by neuroscientists at Caltech for being extremely accurate.</p>
<p class="in_para">Please excuse all the movie references, but although various forms of amnesia are common in fiction, they’re actually rare in real life and usually brief. The closest most of us get to any of this is a temporary version brought on by one too many cocktails. But not for you and your 1994 issue. This is chronic. And as we <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160" title="160"></span>saw with HSAM, memory is poorly understood, even by experts. Doctors can’t fix this.</p>
<p class="in_para">So reading this book is kind of a lost cause for you. Tomorrow you won’t remember what you read today. Upside is you can enjoy your favorite TV episodes again and again like it’s the first time you watched them. Dealing with people is harder. Unless you met them in 1994, they’ll always be strangers to you, even if you see them every day. You’ll register the awkwardness, their expectations, but you won’t know why they think they know you. Every day.</p>
<p class="in_para">Thank god you trust your own handwriting. You’ve left a lot of notes for yourself. A system that helps you get by. But going out is still always a risk. Sometimes the memories don’t last a day; sometimes it’s just minutes and you’re full-on Dory from <i class="calibre4">Finding Nemo</i>. And it’ll be like this again tomorrow. And every day. You will awaken with your mind in 1994, but the world will have moved forward.</p>
<p class="in_para">Luckily, this is not your life. But it is the real life of Michelle Philpots. After two vehicle accidents in the mid-90s, she had seizures and her memory began deteriorating. And then one day it just stopped making new memories that lasted more than a day.</p>
<p class="in_para">Yes, it’s tragic, but it’s not all bad. She’s not alone. She has her husband, Ian. Um, actually, it’s more nuanced than that. In 1994, Ian was her boyfriend. So every morning, to her, he’s still her boyfriend (and a boyfriend that has aged dramatically overnight). But to Ian, and to the rest of the world, he is her husband and has been for over two decades.</p>
<p class="in_para">So Ian must remind her. Every day. Well, actually, not “remind” her, because the memories aren’t there. He doesn’t say “we’re married” and then she replies “Oh yeah!” He says “we’re married” and she says “Really?!?” And Ian breaks out the wedding <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161" title="161"></span>album, just like he did yesterday. (And in our continuing discussion of amnesia-related cinema, if you’re thinking of the Adam Sandler–Drew Barrymore movie <i class="calibre4">Fifty First Dates</i>, you get a gold star.)</p>
<p class="in_para">And he must be pretty convincing, because he gets her to believe it every day. Imagine having to gaslight your spouse every morning—but with the truth. It must seem like an elaborate prank to her at first. Sure, she can see in the mirror that she’s no longer thirty-one, but emotionally it must be difficult to accept this thing everyone else keeps calling “reality.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Can love really survive when the memories are gone? I’m pleased to be able to answer that with a confident yes. The science here is fascinating. As we saw with HSAM, all memories are not the same. With that condition, memory for abstract facts (“semantic memory”) is normal. But HSAM’ers had perfect recollection of personal events (“episodic memory”). Those are distinct and separate in the brain. Jason Bourne didn’t forget his martial arts skills, and that’s accurate. In retrograde amnesia people forget their past, but they don’t lose “procedural memory”—how to walk, how to drive a car, or, in Bourne’s case, how to kick ass. Michelle has lost the ability to make new semantic and episodic memories, but her procedural memory is okay. She may not remember the password to her smartphone, but she can remember the pattern of digits she punches in with her fingers.</p>
<p class="in_para">But those aren’t the only types of memory we have. Wonderfully, we also have “emotional memory.” In anteretrograde amnesia those feelings of love remain and can still grow, even if the facts and events don’t stick. Luckily, Michelle remembers the love she and Ian had back in the nineties. And those emotional memories can compound. Only the facts of their story must be refreshed every day. So tomorrow morning, Ian will take out their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162" title="162"></span>wedding album yet again to patiently remind her of the story of their love.</p>
<p class="in_para">Maybe he tweaks the story some days. Not maliciously, of course. He certainly edits and condenses it, so it definitely changes. He must rewrite it to some degree simply because his own brain does that.</p>
<p class="in_para">What would you give to be able to rewrite the past a bit? A second chance. To live a fresh, new story of love? The feelings are always there, but imagine a new and improved story to bolster them. To rekindle it daily. A ritual of reminding and rewriting love. A small ember can become a roaring fire yet again when tended to. A phoenix reborn.</p>
<p class="in_para">You may not have anteretrograde amnesia, but that doesn’t mean this is less true for you. You can not only remind yourself of your love story, but you can rewrite it as well. The hope and power of a rewritten story is no less true for you.</p>
<p class="in_para">To stay the same, it must change. This is how you fall in love with someone over and over again.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">Romantic love requires a defibrillator. Something that keeps the heart going when it stops or gets wonky. We want the magic back. That story, that idealization from early love. And we can get it. We saw in the MRI data some couples do maintain it for decades. But how?</p>
<p class="in_para">I am happy to report there is some balance in the universe. Yes, NSO is scary, but there’s also PSO: positive sentiment override. That’s the fancy term for the magic, the idealization, the not-exactly-true but oh-so-wonderful story. If those caught in the Hades of NSO are biased negatively, constantly scanning for their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163" title="163"></span>partner’s errors, those with PSO wake up seeking to confirm all that is good and wonderful about their partner and their relationship. The positive things are lasting; the negative stuff, well, my wonderful spouse must be having a tough day.</p>
<p class="in_para">The idealization of early romantic love is not under our control. That’s why it feels like a fairy tale. But we’ve seen it often fades, and entropy can be equally inexorable. To renew love, we must be proactive and deliberate. We can’t wait for the magic; we must make magic. Lucky for us, PSO can be built and sustained.</p>
<p class="in_para">I dumped a lot of sad stats on you at the beginning of this chapter, but a lot of good stuff is coming—or at least it can be good if we roll up our sleeves. We’re going to cover a lot of techniques speed-round-style to not only build that 5:1 ratio but to shift things closer to that wonderful state of biased PSO. Paralleling Gottman’s Four Horsemen, we’re going to take four steps to get there. We’ll call them the Four Rs.</p>
