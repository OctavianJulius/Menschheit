<p class="non_para">It had been nothing less than a whirlwind romance. Nisan first locked eyes with Nemutan at a comic-book convention in Tokyo. It wasn’t long before they were taking trips to the beach together. And then it was weekend getaways to Kyoto or Osaka, smiling and giggling as they took pictures of themselves as a couple. In the blink of an eye, they’d been together three years. As Nisan would tell the <i class="calibre4">New York Times</i>, “I’ve experienced so many amazing things because of her. She has really changed my life.”</p>
<p class="in_para">By the way, Nemutan is a pillow. More accurately, a 2-D animated character printed on a pillow case. (Yeah, I know, things just got real weird real fast.) Nemutan is a sexy, bikini-clad anime character from <i class="calibre4">Da Capo</i>, a video game. Nisan actually has seven pillowcases of her. He keeps one at the office for nights when he has to work late. “She’s great for falling asleep with on an office chair.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Sorry, ladies, he’s taken . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Okay, that was mean. And it’s really, really easy to be mean here. Thing is, he’s not the only one. Falling in love with 2-D characters is becoming somewhat of a trend. And it’s not just pillowcases. <i class="calibre4">Love Plus</i> is a popular video game in Japan where men can interact with virtual girlfriends. Flirting and kissing with digital beauties that, uh . . . don’t really exist. Romantic video games are becoming a big business in Japan, with the market leader bringing in over one hundred million dollars in 2016.</p>
<p class="in_para">And it’s not all 2-D either. Sex robots are already here and quickly going full <i class="calibre4">Westworld</i>. Abyss Creations is adding voices, AI software, and animatronic faces to their silicone sex dolls. Of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199" title="199"></span>course, you have control over what they look like. Choose the hair color, bust size, and body shape you prefer.</p>
<p class="in_para">Yes, the needle on the creepy meter has just gone into the red—but don’t get the impression that this is all about sex. As for Nisan, he might be a better boyfriend than I am. He escorts Nemutan out for karaoke on Friday nights, and they even take adorable photo-booth pictures together. And Konami, the behemoth company that makes a number of dating sim games, even organizes a summer beach convention where players can unite for a weekend getaway with their digital sweethearts. Sociologist Masahrio Yamada reports 12 percent of young adults surveyed said they had experienced serious romantic feelings for video game or other fictional characters.</p>
<p class="in_para">And the virtual love market isn’t limited to socially awkward dudes; it’s gone equal opportunity with the equivalent of Stepford husbands. Otome games for women are basically interactive romance novels. Far from dating Mario, they’re a digital world of hot, dominant hunks; think Jane Austen meets <i class="calibre4">Fifty Shades of Grey</i>. And, again, this is no quirky fad. In 2014 romantic games by Voltage Inc. were played by over twenty-two million women. Nor is this just a “Japan thing.” In November 2015 two games by Voltage broke into the top thirty highest-grossing apps in the United States. Which leads us to the biggest question that is on your mind right now:</p>
<p class="in_para"><span class="make_smallcaps">JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON</span>?</p>
<p class="in_para">A 2020 academic study appropriately titled “What Factors Attract People to Play Romantic Video Games?” found that there was only one trait associated with wanting to play: loneliness. In interview after interview, when asked about their digital loves, the gamers don’t talk about beauty or sexy bodies, just themes of a desire for companionship and acceptance.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200" title="200"></span>Between 2002 and 2015 the percentage of unmarried and unpartnered Japanese women ages twenty to twenty-four went from 38.7 percent to 55.3 percent. For men the same age it grew from 48.8 percent to 67.5 percent. And the percentage of that age group who have <i class="calibre4">never</i> had a sexual experience hit roughly 47 percent for both men and women in 2015.</p>
<p class="in_para">Okay, so they need to get out and date more? But here’s the thing—that doesn’t seem to be the problem. A Japanese government survey found 37.6 percent of young people don’t <i class="calibre4">want</i> a romantic partner. Why? Most said it was “bothersome.” Real relationships seem too difficult, too much of a risk. Japanese men say they don’t want the <i class="calibre4">mendokusai</i> (“too much trouble”) of human relationships. And their female counterparts agree. When talking about the upside of Otome games, one woman said, “It’s an ideal love story—there are no female rivals and no sad endings.”</p>
<p class="in_para">They want the frictionless control and convenience that comes only from technology, with someone who isn’t human. Virtual partners don’t have unreasonable expectations. They don’t reject you, ghost you, or cause you anxiety. And if there are problems, you can restart the game with no awkward breakup conversations. It’s none of the grief with, well, <i class="calibre4">some</i> of the upside.</p>
<p class="in_para">No, I don’t think most of us will be finding our future soulmate in the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond pillow aisle, but this is a long way from the harmless distraction of Tamagotchi games. We’re dealing with an epidemic of loneliness, but what’s even more concerning is the new ways we’re trying to address it, ways that don’t seem headed for long-term fulfillment and happiness.</p>
<p class="in_para">Why do we keep reaching for technology instead of each other?</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_201" title="201"></span>Being lonely sucks. Meanwhile, being popular is good. Like <i class="calibre4">really</i> good. Being popular as a kid made a huge difference in people’s lives decades later—and in some very surprising ways. Research by Mitch Prinstein, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at UNC Chapel Hill, shows popular kids do better in school and go on to have stronger marriages and better relationships, and make more money as adults. They’re happier and they live longer. Popularity was more predictive of these positive results than IQ, family background, or psychological issues. And what about the unpopular? You guessed it: a greater risk of illness, depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Yeesh.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now before I trigger a class war between the jocks and the nerds, it’s important to note something else: there are <i class="calibre4">two</i> kinds of popularity. The first is status. Status is about power and influence. Think of the cool kids in high school. And you can achieve status by some very unsavory means like bullying. “Proactive aggression” doesn’t make you well liked, but, sadly, it does increase status.</p>
<p class="in_para">Like it or not, we all naturally have some desire for status. We would all like to be more successful in achieving what psychologists call “extrinsic goals”: power, influence, and control. This is wired deep. The reward centers of our brains light up in fMRI studies when we just <i class="calibre4">think</i> about high-status people. And those reward centers glow even brighter when we think people see us as high status. And it makes sense. Status gives us that control over the world that we crave so much. Survey people, and you’ll see that more than half the time they’ll choose status over money. They’d rather have two dollars when everyone else has one than have three dollars when everyone else has four.</p>
<p class="in_para">The problem with status is that it isn’t fulfilling over the long <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202" title="202"></span>term. (Ah, the revenge of the nerds.) Joe Allen at the University of Virginia followed the “cool kids” for a decade after middle school and found that they had more substance abuse problems, lousy relationships, and criminal behavior. And this effect has been replicated around the world. Focusing on status, power, and “extrinsic goals” didn’t lead to good things.</p>
<p class="in_para">This isn’t just true for thirteen-year-olds. What’s it like to have ultimate status? To be famous? The academic research confirms another maxim: it really <i class="calibre4">is</i> lonely at the top. One study titled “Being a Celebrity: A Phenomenology of Fame” showed that while most of us want to be famous to be more loved, ironically, being famous leads to more loneliness. Celebrities have to put up walls to deal with the flood of attention. Other people always wanting something from you makes it difficult to trust anyone. Friends become envious. And so being loved by everyone often ends up producing what the authors call “emotional isolation.” And that has similar effects to what we saw with the middle school cool kids. Celebrities have nearly twice the rate of alcohol problems that the average person does and more than a quadrupling of the suicide rate. Pray that you never get your Warholian fifteen minutes.</p>
<p class="in_para">Why does a focus on status and extrinsic goals so often lead to problems? Because it’s usually a trade-off. Only 35 percent of high-status people are also very “likable.” When we devote our time to acquiring power and control, what we’re not doing is focusing on “intrinsic” goals like love and connection. And maintaining status can require behaviors that are downright antithetical to good relationships, like bullying. Being liked often means ceding power.</p>
<p class="in_para">And that leads us to the other type of popularity: being likable. A focus on intrinsic goals. Likable people may not have the same <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203" title="203"></span>sway that high-status folks do, but they’re the ones we trust and feel warm around. They’re cooperative and kind. And this type of popularity does lead to happiness. Edward Deci, a professor at the University of Rochester, summarizes the research: “Even though our culture puts a strong emphasis on attaining wealth and fame, pursuing these goals does not contribute to having a satisfying life. The things that make your life happy are growing as an individual, having loving relationships, and contributing to your community.” Those stats I mentioned about all the benefits of popularity? Those come from the likable-popular, not the status-popular. A multidecade study of over ten thousand kids in Sweden showed that more often it was likability that led to long-term happiness and success.</p>
<p class="in_para">This parallels what we were discussing earlier at the cultural level. Our desire for individualistic control gave us a lot of power, like status does. But it also bred disconnection and isn’t as fulfilling as being likable and having a community of people who love you. So we’re dealing with the status versus likable death match at the societal level. Guess what? Likability and intrinsic goals aren’t winning.</p>
<p class="in_para">What do you want your daughter to be when she grows up? A CEO? A senator? President of Yale? Those were all options on a survey given to 653 middle school students. And they all lost to “personal assistant to a very famous singer or movie star,” which garnered 43.4 percent of the vote.</p>
<p class="in_para">Today’s young people want to be famous more than anything else. A 2007 Pew Research study of young Americans found “their generation’s top goals are fortune and fame.” We can see it in the media. Between 1983 and 2005 there were no TV shows about kids becoming famous. After 2006, nearly 50 percent of shows on the Disney Channel are about that subject.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204" title="204"></span>In our individualistic culture today, status is on its way to becoming synonymous with self-worth, and as Prinstein points out, this isn’t a great recipe for happiness. It is, however, a great recipe for narcissism. A 2010 study of over fourteen thousand college students noted a <i class="calibre4">40</i> percent decline in empathy over the past few decades, while a separate study (“Egos Inflating over Time”) found scores on the Narcissism Personality Index increased by almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2006 among a similar cohort. In the twenty-first century, narcissism has been increasing as quickly as obesity.</p>
<p class="in_para">When we feel connected to others, control is less important because we feel help is there. But when we’re lonely, our brain scans for threats twice as fast. We need control over the environment to feel safe. And that desperate need for control in an ever more individualistic world is affecting our relationships. Not only how we handle them but the kind we choose and the form they take. We want ones where we have control. We don’t want social relationships; now we want what psychologists call <i class="calibre4">parasocial</i> relationships.</p>
<p class="in_para">The concept was created in 1956 to describe the pseudo-relationships people would develop with television characters. Researchers Cohen and Metzger wrote that “television represents the perfect guest—one who comes and leaves at our whim.” Relationships on our terms. Laughs and warmth without all the grief of dealing with other people who have their own needs. They don’t let you down, they don’t ask to borrow money, and you can turn them off when you’ve had enough. MIT professor Sherry Turkle says that they “offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship.”</p>
<p class="in_para">And it’s shocking how powerful these parasocial relationships can be. In 2007 there was a television writers’ strike, and a lot of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_205" title="205"></span>shows temporarily stopped releasing new episodes. What was the emotional effect on viewers who had developed strong parasocial bonds with their favorite fictional characters? A 2011 study put it bluntly: it was like a <i class="calibre4">breakup</i>. If you’re starting to think “real relationships are to parasocial relationships what sex is to porn,” you have the right idea. Emotional porn.</p>
<p class="in_para">And just like time spent trying to acquire status steals time away from being likable, guess where the time for TV comes from? Exactly: from time spent with real people. But TV isn’t as fulfilling as social time. Heavy TV viewers are less happy and have higher anxiety. It’s trading a sumptuous dinner for the empty calories and low nutritional value of junk food. But this isn’t just a problem for individuals; throughout the twentieth century it became a problem for society.</p>
<p class="in_para">Harvard professor Robert Putnam’s book <i class="calibre4">Bowling Alone</i> is the best dystopian science fiction novel you’ll ever read—except that it’s not fiction. He meticulously details the decline of American community involvement over the final quarter of the twentieth century. Between 1985 and 1994 there was a 45 percent drop in involvement in community organizations. No time for bowling leagues and Boy Scouts anymore. The time spent on family dinner dropped by 43 percent. Inviting friends over dropped by 35 percent. Putnam writes, “Virtually all forms of family togetherness became less common over the last quarter of the twentieth century.” And the primary culprit he identified? Television.</p>
<p class="in_para">But now it’s the twenty-first century. Our parasocial desires haven’t changed but the technology has. Those studies where the loss of TV characters was like a breakup? Well, guess what happens when you put people in an MRI and play the sounds and vibrations of a smartphone? No, it doesn’t show all those awful signs of addiction. It’s not a brain screaming with drug-addled <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206" title="206"></span>craving—it’s love. You react to your smartphone as if it’s a family member or a significant other.</p>
<p class="in_para">Technology isn’t as inherently evil as some have made it out to be. The real problem is, just like television, we often use tech time to replace face-to-face interaction and community activities. Norman Nie of Stanford says, “For every personal e-mail message sent or received there is almost a 1-minute drop in the amount of time spent with family. With a mean of 13 personal emails sent and received, that amounts to about 13 minutes less of family time a day, or about 1.5 hours a week.” Chocolate cake is not evil, but if 50 percent of your meals were chocolate cake, um, that’s not a good idea. Use tech to arrange live meetings and it’s an unadulterated good. But when it replaces face-to-face, we’re not getting more connected, we’re growing further apart. And we now spend more time on digital devices than we do sleeping.</p>
<p class="in_para">And all this time focused on screens has created a flywheel effect for our problem with status and extrinsic values. People’s focus on fame, money, and achievement grew significantly between 1967 and 1997, but it positively exploded after 1997. What happened in 1997? The rise of the internet. And just like Putnam noted the decline in community attributable to television, Jake Halpern says those trends have only increased with the rise of digital technologies. Between 1980 and 2005, the number of times that Americans invited friends over to their house declined by half. Club participation dropped by two-thirds in the three decades after 1975. And we are experiencing severe picnic deprivation. Yeah, picnics are down 60 percent over the same period.</p>
<p class="in_para">Famed biologist E. O. Wilson once said, “People must belong to a tribe.” But where are many finding their tribes these days? Video games. Which ones are preferred by people suffering from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207" title="207"></span>internet addiction? Psychotherapist Hilarie Cash told Johann Hari: “The highly popular games are the multiplayer games, where you get to be part of a guild—which is a team—and you get to earn your status in that guild . . . It’s tribalism at its core.” But online communities and live ones are not interchangeable. When Paula Klemm and Thomas Hardie studied online cancer support groups, they found 92 percent of participants were depressed. How many people in live groups were? Zero. They report: “Traditional cancer support groups can help people cope with their cancer, but the efficacy of Internet cancer support groups . . . remains to be proven.” It’s exceedingly easy to replace face-to-face contact with online interaction, but it doesn’t build the same connections. Psychologist Thomas Pollet found that “spending more time on IM or [social networking sites] did not increase the emotional closeness of relationships.”</p>
<p class="in_para">And it’s a double whammy. As we shift more of our time and energy to less fulfilling digital connections, we degrade our ability to connect with others. Remember that 40 percent reduction in empathy among the young? What was it due to? Edward O’Brien, who was part of the research team, said, “The ease of having ‘friends’ online might make people more likely to just tune out when they don’t feel like responding to others’ problems, a behavior that could carry over offline . . . Add in the hypercompetitive atmosphere and inflated expectations of success, borne of celebrity ‘reality shows,’ and you have a social environment that works against slowing down and listening to someone who needs a bit of sympathy.”</p>
<p class="in_para">You’re probably thinking we’re all broken forever and the only thing any of us will be able to connect with at this point is a phone charger. Nope. Turkle points to another study of youth: <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208" title="208"></span>“In only five days in a sleepaway camp without their phones, empathy levels come back up. How does this happen? The campers talk to each other.”</p>
<p class="in_para">I don’t know about you, but I can’t afford to have my ability to connect degrade even further. My social skills peaked in preschool. This morning I failed at captcha three times, and all day I’ve been convinced I’m a robot. Technology has brought us tremendous positives, but it also cannibalizes time we could be spending with others as a community. Konrad Zuse, who is considered the father of the modern computer, said, “The danger that computers will become like humans is not as great as the danger that humans will become like computers.”</p>
<p class="in_para">We end up in a place where we have neither community nor solitude, always connected but never fulfilled. Technology and social media aren’t evil, but when they replace real community, we have a problem because we don’t get the meaningful bonds we need. We don’t truly feel “in it together” or “a part of something.” We have too much control and autonomy to have any kind of collective identity.</p>
<p class="in_para">If we got hit with an EMP blast tomorrow, it would destroy our smartphones but it wouldn’t fix our cultural problem. We’re filling the gap with tech and status and control because we’re lacking something better. Psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman said, “The thirst for power is an attempt to escape from loneliness. However, power is never as satisfying as love.”</p>
<p class="in_para">Deep down, we’re still those Homo sapiens on the savannah, and what did they need? Well, there’s an answer. And we’ll get to it by exploring something that will sound totally crazy coming from me, the-science-writer-guy.</p>
<p class="in_para">We need to look at healing crystals and auras, and all the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209" title="209"></span>things I roll my eyes at. (Good grief, I just said something positive about pseudoscience. If you listen closely, you can hear me dying inside.) No, they don’t work. They’re all bunk. But in all that bunk we’ll find the secret to why our modern world has become so problematic, and where we’ll find the much-needed hope for the future we need right now . . .</p>
