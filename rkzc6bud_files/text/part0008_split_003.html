<section title="Chapter 3" epub:type="bodymatter">
<h2 class="chap_head" id="calibre_pb_3">3. CONSIDER THE OPPOSITE</h2>
<p class="in_paral">Since our brains tend to remember hits and forget misses, we must force ourselves to consider those misses if we want to improve. Paul Nurse takes this attitude to the extreme: “If I have an idea and have observations to support it, rather than get that out there, I go around and look at it in different ways and try and destroy it. And only if it survives do I begin to talk about it.” And maybe that’s why he won the Nobel Prize in medicine.</p>
<p class="in_para_ts"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" title="40"></span>Over the long haul you can also improve by getting to know your personal biases better. What errors do you make consistently? Too quick to assume people are similar to you or different from you? Trusting too much or too little? Adjusting for your consistent biases is a great way to improve.</p>
<p class="in_para">Finally, we have two very human takeaways from our little exploration of confirmation bias. First, listen to that advice you’ve received so many times: <i class="calibre4">make a good first impression</i>. You now know just how important it really is. Make sure you show them the side of your personality that you want them to lock onto—because they will. (However, if you really are a jerk and are meeting me for the first time, please be a jerk. It will help me out enormously. Thanks.)</p>
<p class="in_para">The other thing to remember: <i class="calibre4">give people a second chance</i>. Without the above strategies, you’re right only 70 percent of the time, max. You’re going to be wrong with at least three out of every ten people you meet. But it gets worse than that, as Cornell’s Gilovich points out. Say you meet someone who’s a good person having a lousy day. They make a bad first impression. What do you do? Avoid them, giving them fewer chances to prove you wrong. But if someone makes a good first impression (whether it’s accurate or not), you try to spend more time with them. This gives you a chance to further evaluate them either way. The result is that <i class="calibre4">your negative judgments about people will be less reliable than your positive judgments</i>. And research also shows we have a higher bar for rating someone positively than negatively, and our positive impressions are more easily reversed than our negative ones. There’s no appeals process when you avoid someone for the rest of your life.</p>
<p class="in_para">So your first impression intuition just got better. But overall, reading someone like a book is still on shaky ground, and we <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41" title="41"></span>know that passively reading someone like Sherlock Holmes does is pretty much out. Any other tips from the research we can use to eke out better results? Well, anytime we try to learn about someone, there’s a chance that person is going to mislead us. So how do we deal with liars?</p>
