<p class="non_para">Dr. Giovanni Borromeo just wanted the deaths to stop. In 1943 a lethal new disease swept through his district in Rome. The doctors called it “Syndrome K” because they had no idea what it was. Contagious in the extreme, the infected had to be kept in a separate, locked ward.</p>
<p class="in_para">The initial stages of the disease resembled tuberculosis, but its progression was far more diabolical, causing neurological symptoms like paralysis and dementia. Finally, patients would die from being unable to breathe. The children suffered the worst. You always knew when you were close to the Syndrome K ward because the harsh, relentless coughing of the little ones pierced the air and echoed through the halls.</p>
<p class="in_para">No one had ever seen anything like it before. The underlying pathogen had not been identified, and there was no treatment. Epidemiology was still in its infancy and the war was still raging in Europe, so there was no help. Giovanni’s greatest fear was that it would spread, not merely inside the confines of his beloved hospital, but to the rest of Rome. Only twenty-five years prior, the 1918 flu had infected five hundred million people and eliminated nearly 5 percent of the world’s population.</p>
<p class="in_para">The situation was bad and quickly getting worse, but at least he was at the perfect place. Fatebenefratelli Hospital sits on a small island in the Tiber River and had a tradition of waging war against burgeoning epidemics. In 1656 it battled plague; in 1832 its enemy was cholera. It was a sanctuary, and its doctors would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231" title="231"></span>do what they had always done: fight to save lives, no matter the cost.</p>
<p class="in_para">But disease was not the only threat. If Syndrome K didn’t kill Giovanni, the Nazis might. They did inspections of the hospital, and they didn’t appreciate his interference. Some of the staff would mumble that he should let them check the Syndrome K ward as they wished. But Giovanni was committed to saving lives. He hated the Nazis, but he was not going to let them die. He repeatedly refused them entrance to the Syndrome K wing.</p>
<p class="in_para">One time it became heated. Giovanni wondered if they would drag him away for his impudence. But when the Nazis heard the savage coughing of the children, they changed their minds and left.</p>
<p class="in_para">It was a terrible time. He did what he could. Giovanni just wanted the deaths to stop. Eventually, the war ended. The Nazis never did kill him. And as a good doctor, he never did let them risk their lives entering the Syndrome K ward. Another miracle was that he never became infected himself . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">But, then again, Judaism isn’t contagious.</p>
<p class="in_para">You see, my dear reader, Syndrome K didn’t exist. It was a story. A lie. Like I said, Giovanni Borromeo <i class="calibre4">just wanted the deaths to stop</i>. The deaths of innocent Jews, that is. Fatebenefratelli was a haven.</p>
<p class="in_para">Back in October, the Nazis rounded up ten thousand of Rome’s Jews and shipped them to the camps. The Jewish ghetto was across from Fatebenefratelli. The few who evaded capture sought refuge in the hospital. Giovanni and his fellow doctors took them in. But there were too many to conceal. And they kept coming. Without a plan, the Nazis would notice and everyone would die. And so they created a story: “Syndrome K.”</p>
<p class="in_para">As Adriano Ossicini, another doctor at the hospital, later said <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232" title="232"></span>in an interview, “We created those papers for Jewish people as if they were ordinary patients, and in the moment when we had to say what disease they suffered? It was Syndrome K, meaning ‘I am admitting a Jew,’ as if he or she were ill, but they were all healthy.”</p>
<p class="in_para">The doctors were terrified, but that didn’t stop them from having a little fun to relieve the tension. The K in Syndrome K? They named their fictional disease after the local Nazi commander, Kesselring. And by making the disease seem so horrible and locking the “victims” in a private ward, they scared the Nazis away from further investigations.</p>
<p class="in_para">Yeah, that one time it reached a scary point. It seemed like the Nazis were going to arrest Giovanni, march into the Syndrome K wing, and discover the ruse. Luckily, one of the staff was in the ward and playfully encouraged the children to cough as loudly and horribly as they could. That did the trick. The Nazis didn’t want to catch whatever was causing those terrible sounds.</p>
<p class="in_para">In 1961, Giovanni died in the same hospital he saved lives in. He didn’t die from the terribly virulent Syndrome K. No one ever had. But over one hundred people lived because of it. And in 2004, Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust remembrance organization, declared Borromeo “righteous among the nations.” A hero.</p>
<p class="in_para">The story was a lie. Syndrome K was not real. But, far more important, the lives it saved were.</p>
<p class="ornament">* * *</p>
<p class="non_para">In the <a href="part0004.html#3Q280-9896b344afed442dbebc9e6866d0dc42" class="calibre1">introduction</a> to this book, I promised you the answer to the meaning of life. And now we’re almost at the end. So, uh, time to deliver, I guess. (Note to self: gotta handle this tactfully. People have been burned at the stake for getting this wrong.)</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233" title="233"></span>Almost by definition, meaning is something that must connect <i class="calibre4">everything</i> in life. The meaning of life must be something that, beneath the surface, motivates the majority of what we do, makes us happy when we are in line with it and unhappy when we are not.</p>
<p class="in_para">So, enough throat clearing: What is the one true meaning of life?</p>
<p class="in_para">Heck if I know. Look, I understand you were expecting some real Morgan-Freemanesque wisdom here, but I’m not licensed to practice metaphysics in the state of California. Sure, I have a metric ton of research studies, but I don’t have a hotline to eternal truth. Ask me about something as deep as the one true meaning of life, and I’m looking around like the kid at the mall who can’t find his mom.</p>
<p class="in_para">I know, I know, that’s not a very satisfying answer. But, really, you can’t blame me. I looked it up, and the question of “What is the meaning of life?” is actually pretty new. Believe it or not, it first appeared in English in 1843 . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Hey, hold on a second. Nineteenth century. Just like loneliness. Before then, meaning came prepackaged and ready-made. We had stories that satisfied the need for meaning, so we didn’t bother to ask. Then all those new individualistic ideas started taking over. Science bloomed. It gave us better answers about the material world and more control over it, which was quite welcome. But it didn’t fill the emotional void it created when we lost our stories of meaning . . .</p>
<p class="in_para">Hmm. Maybe there is an answer. Let’s come at this from another angle. Let’s ask: <i class="calibre4">What predicts how meaningful we perceive life to be?</i> And a 2013 study found a very robust and clear answer to that question: a sense of belonging.</p>
<p class="in_para">In fact, that paper, “To Belong Is to Matter: Sense of Belonging <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234" title="234"></span>Enhances Meaning in Life,” didn’t just find a correlation. Belonging <i class="calibre4">caused</i> a feeling of meaning in life. And this wasn’t some scientific one-off. Another paper by the same author, Roy Baumeister, a professor at Florida State University, posited a need to belong as the “master motive” of our species. And far from being met with resistance, that study has been cited more than twenty-four thousand times.</p>
<p class="in_para">Belonging. It’s why our species’ superpower is cooperation. It’s what we saw with drug addiction hijacking the social reward pathways of the human brain. It’s what we saw with the placebo effect curing ills by telling your body someone cares.</p>
<p class="in_para">Alright, I’m not looking for mom anymore. Morgan-Freemanesque wisdom coming up. I humbly submit to you: <i class="calibre4">belonging is the meaning of life</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Before the nineteenth century and individualism, all our ideologies were stories of belonging and connection, reminding us that we’re not alone and that you’re not the only character in the story. Meaning and belonging have always come wrapped in stories and helped form the ideologies we live by.</p>
<p class="in_para">Now some are gonna say, “Most of those stories weren’t true.” And I don’t deny that. As Neal Gaiman said, “Stories may well be lies, but they are good lies that say true things.” The stories aren’t always true, but, like Syndrome K, the people around us <i class="calibre4">are</i>. Science builds models to try and understand the world, and they’re never perfect, but they do give us insights. That’s why the old saying is “all models are wrong but some models are useful.” That phrase is true for our stories as well. Their primary purpose, whether we knew it or not, wasn’t truth but unity. They don’t always get the facts right, but they do get the meaning of life right: belonging. Just like your body accepts a fake story in the placebo effect. The acupuncture doesn’t help, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235" title="235"></span>but the care it delivers is a clear signal of belonging, and that’s what’s important.</p>
<p class="in_para">The inaccuracy of our stories hasn’t been the biggest problem for humans. Oh, no. What’s really screwed things up for us is when the story of Group A didn’t match the story of Group B. The power of belonging is so strong that we put the brass knuckles on when our stories are challenged. You don’t need a history PhD to see that fighting over stories has caused a lot of problems for humankind. I talked a lot about the bonding that occurs within a group during war, but I conveniently didn’t mention what caused the war in the first place. Our species superpower may be cooperation inside a group that shares a story, but we’ve been all too willing to kill members of a group who have a different story.</p>
<p class="in_para">So what’s the answer? How do we maintain belonging when our stories are mutually exclusive? The solution is simple: <i class="calibre4">more stories</i>. We can always create another story to unite us in a new way. We do it now. You may not be my family, but you are my friend. You may not be my religion, but we are part of the same nation. We may not have any of these in common, but we may both be Star Wars fans. New stories can unite us when the old ones fail to. We can always be a part of the same tribe and share a story of belonging. We have an infinite number of ways to connect if we try. We don’t need war or disaster to refresh our factory setting of cooperation. In the nineteenth century our dominant meta-story changed. But we can change it again if we want to.</p>
<p class="in_para">Maybe it’s time for a little less science and a few more stories. Yeah, that’s ironic coming from me. I’m the guy who’s been pushing scientific studies into your eyeballs for a few hundred pages. But I also included stories in this book, didn’t I? And a 2020 study said: “We find anecdotal evidence to be more persuasive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236" title="236"></span>than statistical evidence when emotional engagement is high, as when issues involve a severe threat, health, or oneself.” Yes, I am a sneaky bastard. But it’s all the more proof that we <i class="calibre4">need</i> stories.</p>
<p class="in_para">I still like facts and statistics. They’re incredibly valuable and have dramatically improved our lives. That said, we won’t find the meaning of life through scientific theories. We need a uniting story that goes beyond the individual and makes us feel we belong. Mark Twain wrote, “Don’t part with your illusions. When they are gone you may still exist, but you have ceased to live.”</p>
<p class="in_para">You need to belong. And we all need a story to unite us. This book isn’t “choose your own adventure”—but your life is. So this is not an ending. It’s a beginning.</p>
<p class="in_para">We’ve looked at alien microwaves, genius horses, thieving hermits, the perils of perfect memories, Casanova, leper colonies, super soldiers, soccer liars, pillow girlfriends and placebos, friendships between preachers and pornographers, Mrs. Sherlock Holmes, the trolling of Edgar Allan Poe, hostage negotiators, handcuffs in the delivery room, the friendliest people in the world, vetoing Viagra, and fooling Nazis with fake diseases. I want to thank you for coming on this crazy journey with me.</p>
<p class="in_para">I hope you learned something. I sure did. I have experienced deep regret in learning some of these lessons too late. I hope to have spared you some of that. I’m the guy who scored a four out of one hundred on Agreeableness, but the most memorable moments of my life, the ones that moved me the most, are not the ones where I was alone. They’re always the ones when I was with a group where I felt accepted. Where I felt I belonged.</p>
<p class="in_para">And if you’re not feeling you belong right now, don’t forget the magic placebo healing powers of this book. Seriously, they’re as pain relieving as acupuncture. Just by holding it in your hands <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_237" title="237"></span>right now the midi-chlorians embedded in the cover are healing your pain. Science says so. Here’s my email if you want to write to me: eb@bakadesuyo.com.</p>
<p class="in_para">I now realize I needed this book more than you do. All my life, my story has been a solitary one. Not a buddy comedy or a romance or an ensemble drama. A one-man show. But I’ve learned a lesson from the loneliness of Frankenstein’s monster. A book like this doesn’t come together by spending a lot of time with friends. It comes from time spent alone. Perhaps too much time alone.</p>
<p class="in_para">So I have to go now. I have to see my friends. I need to hug them and tell them I love them. Maybe say to them, “I’d like to eat your intestines.” I have a lot to fix and make up for. But now, I have a better idea how to start.</p>
<p class="in_para">There’s an old African proverb that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” I have gone fast for many, many years. But the road is much longer than I thought. Fast isn’t going to cut it anymore. I need to go far.</p>
<p class="in_para">Can we go together?</p>
