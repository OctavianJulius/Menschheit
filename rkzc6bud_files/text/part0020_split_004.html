<section title="Chapter 13" epub:type="bodymatter">
<h2 class="chap_head" id="calibre_pb_4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155" title="155"></span>4. CONTEMPT</h2>
<p class="in_paral">Contempt is the single biggest predictor of divorce that Gottman found. Contempt is anything that implies your partner is inferior to you. Calling them names, ridiculing or putting them down are all examples. (Yes, eye-rolling is one of the worst things you can do in a marriage, and that’s backed by data.) Contempt is almost never seen in happy marriages. Gottman refers to it as “sulfuric acid for love.” Simply put, it is the path to NSO. Do not do it.</p>
<p class="in_para_ts">I’m going to be very realistic here. You’re not going to remember everything in this chapter. So if you forget everything else, remember this: <i class="calibre4">how you start an argument is double-super-extra important</i>. Just by listening to the first three minutes of an argument, Gottman could predict the result 96 percent of the time. Plain and simple: if it starts harsh, it’s going to end harsh. And harsh startup not only predicted the outcome of the conversation, it predicted divorce. If you know you’re raising an issue with your partner that might lead to a fight, take a deep breath first. Complain, don’t criticize. Describe it neutrally. Start positive. You may be right, but you don’t need to make this harder than necessary by starting it as an attack.</p>
<p class="in_para">This is a lot of stuff to remember, I know. And, in the shrieking confusion of the moment, it will be even harder to do properly. But that’s okay. The first three horsemen are present even in happy marriages. Nobody’s perfect. Remember how I said the Four Horsemen predict divorce 83.3 percent of the time? Yeah, 83.3 is not 100. And the reason it’s not 100 is what Gottman calls “repair”: soothing and supporting each other, laughing or showing affection in the midst of an argument. Take their hand. Make a joke. This dials back escalation. Even couples with lots of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156" title="156"></span>horsemen riding around can have happy stable marriages if they repair. And one reason NSO is so deadly is that it prevents you from seeing those repair attempts by your partner. That means the conflict car has no brakes.</p>
<p class="in_para">What’s an overall perspective to keep in mind that encapsulates much of this? Well, Gottman emphasizes the importance of friendship in a marriage and that is very true. But I think a more useful idea to keep in mind is writer Alain de Botton’s notion of <i class="calibre4">treating them like a child</i>. No, don’t be condescending like you might with a kid, but we create a lot of problems because we expect our partner to always be a competent, emotionally stable “adult.” They’re not. I’m not. And you’re not. As humorist Kin Hubbard once said, “Boys will be boys, and so will a lot of middle-aged men.” Showing the generosity and compassion that you naturally give to a child when they’re upset is a simple way to get around many of the problems we create. We’re just less likely to think a child is motivated by conscious malice. We think they must be tired, hungry, or moody. This is, frankly, an excellent thing to do with <i class="calibre4">anyone</i>.</p>
<p class="in_para">Don’t expect someone to always be rational. When Tom Stoneham, a professor of philosophy at the University of York, is teaching logic, he always says, “Don’t use this at home or you’ll end up unhappily single.” When a five-year-old starts shouting and calling you names, you don’t immediately shout back and call them a poopyhead. With kids we usually treat emotions as information, and this is great advice. We suspend judgment, listen, and stick to the real problem at hand. We’re just a lot more charitable. And that injection of positive emotion makes all the difference. Adulting is hard, and when someone relieves us of that enormous responsibility and realizes that inside we’re always a bit of a moody child, it works wonders. And this isn’t just speculation. A 2001 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157" title="157"></span>study shows people who are compassionate with their partner during arguments have 34 percent fewer of them, and they last half as long.</p>
<p class="in_para">Awesome. We’re done, right? Nope.</p>
<p class="in_para">Reducing negativity and fighting isn’t enough. That might make a marriage hunky-dory (a technical term for “okey dokey”), but it won’t make it great. I currently have a “not negative” relationship with every stranger on this planet. That’s not love. Yes, reducing the truly lethal negatives like the Four Horsemen is necessary—but not sufficient. Studies have shown that while negatives hurt, it’s actually the loss of the positive that speeds marriages to the grave.</p>
<p class="in_para">More specifically, Gottman realized that the most important thing is a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative. This is why the raw amount of negative doesn’t matter. As long as you have enough good times to offset it, a relationship can thrive. Couples headed for divorce typically have a ratio of 0.8 positives for every negative. But you don’t want to have too little negative either. If you hit 13 positives to every negative, you’re probably not communicating enough. Gotta talk, gotta fight. It’s a balance. (What’s fascinating is this applies to all relationships. Friendships need an 8:1 positive to negative ratio. And with your mother-in-law the number is actually 1,000:1.)</p>
<p class="in_para">So we know our next goal: increase the positive. Time to put the funk in functional relationship. We want the “all” version of Eli Finkel’s all-or-nothing marriage.</p>
<p class="in_para">But we don’t merely want the incremental increase of more positive. We want a phase change like NSO—but in the other direction. We want a return to the magic, the idealization. We want confirmation bias back on our side. A brand-spanking-new pair of rose-colored glasses.</p>
<p class="in_para"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158" title="158"></span>This puts me in an interesting spot, actually. I’m the science guy always saying we need to look at the facts and the data and be rational. In the <a href="part0004.html#3Q280-9896b344afed442dbebc9e6866d0dc42" class="calibre1">introduction</a> to this book I swore a blood oath to destroy unscientific myths with Occam’s chainsaw. Very Enlightenment era. But now we need some Romanticism. The delusion. The idealization that is the magic of love. The world is harsh, and we need our illusions to forge a greater truth together.</p>
<p class="in_para">This is new territory for me. I have to go from killer of bias to protector of bias. I can see the summer movie tagline: <i class="calibre4">What it was designed to destroy, it must now defend.</i> (Why is the theme from <i class="calibre4">Terminator 2</i> playing in my head right now?)</p>
<p class="in_para">So how do we increase the positive and renew the magic of love? Let’s look at someone who has to do just that. On a daily basis, actually . . .</p>
