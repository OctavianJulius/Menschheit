<h2 class="chap_head" id="calibre_pb_4">3. RENEW</h2>
<p class="in_paral">Okay, so you know your partner better. It’s a natural response to want to change them a bit. No, this is not good, at least not the way it’s usually done. A study of 160 people found that this usually doesn’t work and decreases marital satisfaction. Why? Because you’re not objective. You’re saying you know better than they do who they should be. There’s always a bit of selfishness in there. The enormous irony here is that you have to accept someone fully before they can change. As John Gottman notes, our instinct for autonomy is wired deep, so, ironically, people change only when they feel they don’t have to.</p>
<p class="in_paral">There’s a healthy (and effective) way to help your partner move in the direction of positive change. But it starts with who they want to be, not who you want them to be. You have to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170" title="170"></span>help them become their own ideal self. That’s one reason why the love maps process above is so important, for you to ask and know, rather than guess, what this ideal self is.</p>
<p class="in_paral">We got some help from Aristotle on building friendships; for improving partners, we’ll receive assistance from another master: Michelangelo. Speaking about his artistic process, he once said, “The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work.” He didn’t feel that sculpting was creating; it was revealing. The sculpture just has to be freed from the stone around it. And psychologists found the same idea applies to improving your partner.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Just as in romantic love we’re able to see our “real” partner but discount the negatives and idealize them, we can benefit from that here. With the knowledge of the current block of marble and what it has the potential to be, we can better see how the idealized version parallels it.</p>
<p class="in_paral">So how do we actually do this? Think back to when we talked about narcissists and “empathy prompts.” (No, I’m not saying your partner is a narcissist; I’m saying humans are more alike than they are different.) The best way to help them improve was by encouraging instead of shaming. Same applies here. In accepting them as they are, you can still focus on and encourage those aspects aligned with their ideal self, who they most want to be. See the “idealized” sculpture in their realistic marble and encourage that. Nurture the ideal them through support and affirmation. Work on that raw diamond to reveal the beauty within; don’t try to turn it into an emerald because you like the color green.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Simply put, this is a more proactive effort to “bring out the best in someone.” And, given it originated with their own <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171" title="171"></span>goals, it meets far less resistance. You’re not encouraging them to become what you want them to be, you’re encouraging them to be more them. Speak to their best self, encourage their ideal self, and treat them like they already are that person. In a 1996 study, researchers Sandra Murray, John Holmes, and Dale Griffin found that, much like children, adults often come to perceive themselves the way we perceive them. This is why supporting the ideal works and shaming them as bad fails. The delusion of love is necessary because it is a North Star. The lie becomes the truth.</p>
<p class="in_paral">Again, this promotes self-expansion, so guess what? It has some of the same results as self-expansion: “movement toward the ideal self showed positive associations with life and relationship satisfaction.” But not only that, it does help people change, improve, and meet their goals. They do get closer to their ideal self: “Analyses revealed that when partners were more affirming during goal-relevant conversations, targets were more likely to achieve their ideal self goals.” And you can encourage an old dog to learn new tricks. The Michelangelo effect has been shown to work at any age.</p>
<p class="in_paral">It’s idealization all over again, but the deliberate “enlightenment era” version. If we know the “negatives” of a partner but learn the meaning beneath them, we see who they really are and who they can really be. We can then encourage that ideal in a partner and help them actually become that ideal. They become the idealized self, and so the idealization can last. This is a path to a continued romantic love that defies entropy. The Michelangelo effect allows us to fall in love over and over again with same person (without amnesia). Somerset Maugham wrote, “We are not the same persons this year as last, nor are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172" title="172"></span>those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person.” But we don’t have to leave it to chance.</p>
<p class="in_para_ts">Okay, we boosted the feelings and intimacy with self-expansion, created a unique culture of two supported by rituals with love maps, and increased positive growth and improvement with the Michelangelo effect. What encapsulates all this? What ties it all together? It’s the same thing we’ve seen to be central throughout the book thus far. The same thing Michelle Philpots needs daily, and Ian provides. A story . . .</p>
