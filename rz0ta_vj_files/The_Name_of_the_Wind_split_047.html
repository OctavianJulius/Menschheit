Since I was now a member of the Arcanum, I was free to explore the stacks, something I’d been waiting my whole life to do.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Better still, so long as I didn’t ask for any help from the scrivs, nothing would be recorded in the Archive’s ledger books. That meant I could research the Chandrian and the Amyr to my heart’s content, and no one, not even Lorren, need ever know about my “childish” pursuits.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Entering the reddish light of the Archives I found both Ambrose and Fela sitting behind the entry desk. A mixed blessing if ever there was one.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose was leaning toward her, speaking in a low voice. She had the distinctly uncomfortable look of a woman who knows the futility of a polite refusal. One of his hands rested on her knee, while the other arm was draped across the back of her chair, his hand resting on her neck. He meant for it to look tender and affectionate, but there was a tension in her body like that of a startled deer. The truth was he was holding her there, the same way you hold a dog by the scruff of its neck to keep it from running off.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">As the door thumped closed behind me Fela looked up, met my eyes, then looked down and away, ashamed by her predicament. As if she’d done anything. I had seen that look too many times on the streets of Tarbean. It sparked an old anger in me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I approached the desk, making more noise than necessary. Pen and ink lay on the other end of the desk, and a piece of paper three-quarters full of rewriting and crossing out. From the looks of things, Ambrose had been trying to compose a poem.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I reached the edge of the desk and stood for a moment. Fela looked everywhere except at me or Ambrose. She shifted in her seat, uncomfortable, but obviously not wanting to make a scene. I cleared my throat pointedly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose looked over his shoulder, scowling. “You have damnable timing, E’lir. Come back later.” He turned away again, dismissing me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I snorted and leaned over the desk, craning my neck to look at the sheet of paper he’d left lying there. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">I</span></span><span class="calibre6"> have damnable timing? Please, you have thirteen syllables in a line here.” I tapped a finger onto the page. “It’s not iambic either. I don’t know if it’s anything metrical at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He turned to look at me again, his expression irritated. “Mind your tongue, E’lir. The day I come to you for help with poetry is the day-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…is the day you have two hours to spare,” I said. “Two long hours, and that’s just for getting started. ‘So same can the humble thrush well know its north?’ I mean, I don’t even know how to begin to criticize that. It practically mocks itself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What do you know of poetry?” Ambrose said without bothering to turn around.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I know a limping verse when I hear it,” I said. “But this isn’t even limping. A limp has rhythm. This is more like someone falling down a set of stairs. Uneven stairs. With a midden at the bottom.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It is a sprung rhythm,” he said, his voice stiff and offended. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Sprung?” I burst out with an incredulous laugh. “I understand that if I saw a horse with a leg this badly ‘sprung,’ I’d kill it out of mercy, then burn its poor corpse for fear the local dogs might gnaw on it and die.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose finally turned around to face me, and in so doing he had to take his right hand off Fela’s knee. A half-victory, but his other hand remained on her neck, holding her in her chair with the appearance of a casual caress.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I thought you might stop by today,” he said with a brittle cheerfulness. “So I already checked the ledger. You’re not in the lists yet. You’ll have to stick with Tomes or come back later, after they’ve updated the books.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“No offense, but would you mind checking again? I’m not sure I can trust the literacy of someone who tries to rhyme ‘north’ with ‘worth.’ No wonder you have to hold women down to get them to listen to it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose stiffened and his arm slid off the back of the chair to fall at his side. His expression was pure venom. “When you’re older, E’lir, you’ll understand that what a man and a woman do together-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What? In the privacy of the entrance hall of the Archives?” I gestured around us. “God’s body, this isn’t some brothel. And, in case you hadn’t noticed, she’s a student, not some brass nail you’ve paid to bang away at. If you’re going to force yourself on a woman, have the decency to do it in an alleyway. At least that way she’ll feel justified screaming about it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose’s face flushed furiously and it took him a long moment to find his voice. “You don’t know the first thing about women.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“There, at least, we can agree,” I said easily. “In fact, that’s the reason I came here today. I wanted to do some research. Find a book or two on the subject.” I struck the ledger with two fingers, hard. “So look up my name and let me in.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose flipped the book open, found the proper page, and turned the book around to face me. “There. If you can find your name on that list, you are welcome to peruse the stacks at your leisure.” He gave a tight smile. “Otherwise feel free to come back in a span or so. We should have things updated by then.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I had the masters send along a note just in case there was any confusion about my admission to the Arcanum.” I said, and drew my shirt up over my head, turning so he could see the broad expanse of bandages covering my back. “Can you read it from there, or do I need to come closer?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a pointed silence from Ambrose, so I lowered my shirt and turned to face Fela, ignoring him entirely. “My lady scriv,” I said to her with a bow. A very slight bow, as my back wouldn’t permit a deep one. “Would you be so good as to help me locate a book concerning women? I have been instructed by my betters to inform myself on this most subtle subject.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Fela gave a faint smile and relaxed a bit. She had continued sitting stiff and uncomfortable after Ambrose had taken his hand away. I guessed that she knew Ambrose’s temperament well enough to know that if she bolted away and embarrassed him, he would make her pay for it later. “I don’t know if we have anything like that.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I would settle for a primer,” I said with a smile. “I have it on good report that I don’t know the first thing about them, so anything would further my knowledge.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Something with pictures?” Ambrose spat.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“If our search degenerates to that level I’ll be sure to call on you,” I said without looking in his direction. I smiled at Fela. “Perhaps a bestiary,” I said gently. “I hear they are singular creatures, much different than men.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Fela’s smile blossomed and she gave a small laugh. “We could have a look around, I suppose.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose scowled in her direction.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She made a placating gesture toward him. “Everyone knows he’s in the Arcanum, Ambrose,” she said. “What’s the harm of just letting him in?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose glared at her. “Why don’t you run along to Tomes and play the good little fetch-and-carry girl?” he said coldly. “I can handle things out here by myself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Moving stiffly, Fela got up from the desk, gathered up the book she’d been trying to read, and headed into Tomes. As she pulled the door open, I like to think she gave me a brief look of gratitude and relief. But perhaps it was only my imagination.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">As the door swung shut behind her, the room seemed to grow a little dimmer. I am not speaking poetically. The light truly seemed to dim. I looked at the sympathy lamps hanging around the room, wondering what was wrong.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But a moment later I felt a slow, burning sensation begin to creep across my back and realized the truth. The nahlrout was wearing off.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Most powerful painkillers have serious side effects. Tennasin occasionally produces delirium or fainting. Lacillium is poisonous. Ophalum is highly addictive. Mhenka is perhaps the most powerful of all, but there are reasons they call it “devil root.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Nahlrout was less powerful than these, but much safer. It was a mild anesthetic, a stimulant, and a vascular constrictor, which is why I hadn’t bled like a stuck pig when they’d whipped me. Best of all, it had no major side effects. Still, there is always a price to be paid. Once nahlrout wears off, it leaves you physically and mentally exhausted.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Regardless, I had come here to see the stacks. I was now a member of the Arcanum and I didn’t intend to leave until I’d been inside the Archives. I turned back to the desk, my expression resolute.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose gave me a long, calculating look before heaving a sigh. “Fine,” he said. “How about a deal? You keep quiet about what you saw here today, and I’ll bend the rules and let you in even though you aren’t officially in the book.” He looked a little nervous. “How does that sound?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Even as he spoke I could feel the stimulant effect from the nahlrout fading. My body felt heavy and tired, my thoughts grew sluggish and syrupy. I reached up to rub at my face with my hands, and winced as the motion tugged sharply at the stitches all across my back. “That’ll be fine,” I said thickly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose opened up one of the ledger books and sighed as he turned the pages. “Since this is your first time in the Archives proper, you’ll have to pay the stack fee.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mouth tasted strangely of lemons. That was a side effect Ben had never mentioned. It was distracting, and after a moment I saw that Ambrose was looking up at me expectantly. “What?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He gave me a strange look. “The stack fee.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“There wasn’t any fee before,” I said. “When I was in the Tomes.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose looked up at me as if I were an idiot. “That’s because it’s the</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> stack</span></span><span class="calibre6"> fee.” He looked back down at the ledger. “Normally you pay it in addition to your first term’s Arcanum tuition. But since you’ve jumped rank on us, you’ll need to tend to it now.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“How much is it?” I asked, feeling for my purse.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“One talent,” he said. “And you</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> do</span></span><span class="calibre6"> have to pay before you can go in. Rules are Rules.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">After paying for my bunk in Mews, a talent was nearly all my remaining money. I was keenly aware of the fact that I needed to hoard my resources to save for next term’s tuition. As soon as I couldn’t pay, I would have to leave the University.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Still, it was a small price to pay for something I’d dreamed about for most of my life. I pulled a talent out of my purse and handed it over. “Do I need to sign in?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Nothing so formal as that,” Ambrose said as he opened a drawer and pulled out a small metal disk. Stupefied from the side effects of the nahlrout, it took me a moment to recognize it for what it was: a handheld sympathy lamp.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The Stacks aren’t lit,” Ambrose said matter-of-factly. “There’s too much space in there, and it would be bad for the books in the long term. Hand lamps cost a talent and a half.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I hesitated.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose nodded to himself and looked thoughtful. “A lot of folk end up strapped during first term.” He reached down into a lower drawer and rooted around for a long moment. “Hand lamps are a talent and half, and there’s nothing I can do about that.” He brought out a four-inch taper. “But candles are just a ha’penny.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ha’penny for a candle was a remarkably good deal. I brought out a penny. “I’ll take two.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“This is our last one,” Ambrose said quickly. He looked around nervously before pushing it into my hand. “Tell you what. You can have it for free.” He smiled. “Just don’t tell anyone. It’ll be our little secret.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I took the candle, more than a little surprised. Apparently I’d frightened him with my idle threat earlier. Either that or this rude, pompous noble’s son wasn’t half the bastard I’d taken him for.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose hurried me into the stacks as quickly as possible, leaving me no time to light my candle. When the doors swung shut behind me it was as black as the inside of a sack, with only a faint hint of reddish sympathy light coming around the edges of the door behind me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">As I didn’t have any matches with me, I had to resort to sympathy. Ordinarily I could have done it quick as blinking, but my nahlrout-weary mind could barely muster the necessary concentration. I gritted my teeth, fixed the Alar in my mind, and after a few seconds I felt the cold leech into my muscles as I drew enough heat from my own body to bring the wick of the candle sputtering to life.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Books.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">With no windows to let in the sunlight, the stacks were utterly dark except for the gentle light of my candle. Stretching away into the darkness were shelf on shelf of books. More books than I could look at if I took a whole day. More books than I could read in a lifetime.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The air was cool and dry. It smelled of old leather, parchment, and forgotten secrets. I wondered idly how they kept the air so fresh in a building with no windows.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Cupping a hand in front of my candle, I made my flickering way through the shelves, savoring the moment, soaking everything in. Shadows danced wildly back and forth across the ceiling as my candle’s flame moved from side to side.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The nahlrout had worn off completely by this point. My back was throbbing and my thoughts were leaden, as if I had a high fever or had taken a hard blow to the back of the head. I knew I wasn’t going to be up for a long bout of reading, but I still couldn’t bring myself to leave so soon. Not after everything I’d gone through to get here.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I wandered aimlessly for perhaps a quarter hour, exploring. I discovered several small stone rooms with heavy wooden doors and tables inside. They were obviously meant as a place where small groups could meet and talk without disturbing the perfect quiet of the Archives.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I found stairwells leading down as well as up. The Archives was six stories tall, but I hadn’t known it extended underground as well. How deep did it go? How many tens of thousands of books were waiting under my feet?</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I can hardly describe how comforting it was in the cool, quiet dark. I was perfectly content, lost among the endless books. It made me feel safe, knowing that the answers to all my questions were here, somewhere waiting.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was quite by accident that I found the four-plate door.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was made of a solid piece of grey stone the same color as the surrounding walls. Its frame was eight inches wide, also grey, and also one single seamless piece of stone. The door and frame fit together so tightly that a pin couldn’t slide into the crack.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It had no hinges. No handle. No window or sliding panel. Its only features were four hard copper plates. They were set flush with the face of the door, which was flush with the front of the frame, which was flush with the wall surrounding it. You could run your hand from one side of the door to the next and hardly feel the lines of it at all.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">In spite of these notable lacks, the expanse of grey stone was undoubtedly a door. It simply was. Each copper plate had a hole in its center, and though they were not shaped in the conventional way, they were undoubtedly keyholes. The door sat still as a mountain, quiet and indifferent as the sea on a windless day. This was not a door for opening. It was a door for staying closed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">In its center, between the untarnished copper plates, a word was chiseled deep into the stone: VALARITAS.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There were other locked doors in the University, places where dangerous things were kept, where old and forgotten secrets slept: silent and hidden. Doors whose opening was forbidden. Doors whose thresholds no one crossed, whose keys had been destroyed or lost, or locked away themselves for safety’s sake.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But they all paled in comparison to the four-plate door. I lay my palm on the cool, smooth face of the door and pushed, hoping against hope that it might swing open to my touch. But it was solid and unmoving as a greystone. I tried to peer through the holes in the copper plates but couldn’t see anything by the light of my single candle.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I wanted to get inside so badly I could taste it. It probably shows a perverse element of my personality that even though I was finally inside the Archives, surrounded by endless secrets, that I was drawn to the one locked door I had found. Perhaps it is human nature to seek out hidden things. Perhaps it is simply my nature.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Just then I saw the red, unwavering light of a sympathy lamp approaching through the shelves. It was the first sign I’d seen of any other students in the archives. I took a step back and waited, thinking to ask whoever was coming what was behind the door. What</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Valaritas</span></span><span class="calibre6"> meant.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The red light swelled and I saw two scrivs turn a corner. They paused, then one of them bolted to where I stood and snatched my candle away, spilling hot wax on my hand in the process of extinguishing it. His expression couldn’t have been more horrified if he had found me carrying a freshly severed head.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What are you doing with an open flame in here?” he demanded in the loudest whisper I had ever heard. He lowered his voice and waved the now extinguished candle at me. “Charred body of God, what’s the matter with you?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I rubbed at the hot wax on the back of my hand. Trying to think clearly through the fog of pain and exhaustion.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Of course,</span></span><span class="calibre6"> I thought, remembering Ambrose’s smile as he pressed the candle into my hands and hurried me though the door.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> “Our little secret.” Of course. I should have known.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">One of the scrivs led me out of the Stacks while the other ran to fetch Master Lorren. When we emerged into the entryway, Ambrose managed to look confused and shocked. He overacted the part, but it was convincing enough for the scriv accompanying me. “What’s he doing in here?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“We found him wandering around,” the scriv explained.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> “With a candle.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What?” Ambrose’s expression was perfectly aghast. “Well</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> I</span></span><span class="calibre6"> didn’t sign him in,” Ambrose said. He flipped open one of the ledger books. “Look. See for yourself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Before anything else could be said, Lorren stormed into the room. His normally placid expression was fierce and hard. I felt myself sweat cold and I thought of what Teccam wrote in his Theophany:</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lorren towered over the entry desk. “Explain,” he demanded of the nearby scriv. His voice was a tight coil of fury.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Micah and I saw a flickering light in the stacks and we went to see if someone was having trouble with their lamp. We found him near the southeast stairwell with this.” The scriv held up the candle. His hand shook slightly under Lorren’s glare.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lorren turned to the desk where Ambrose sat. “How did this happen, Re’lar?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose raised his hands helplessly. “He came in earlier and I wouldn’t admit him because he wasn’t in the book. We bickered for a while, Fela was here for most of it.” He looked at me. “Eventually I told him he’d have to leave. He must have snuck in when I went into the back room for more ink.” Ambrose shrugged. “Or maybe he slipped in past the desk in Tomes.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I stood there, stupefied. What little part of my mind wasn’t leaden with fatigue was preoccupied with the screaming pain across my back. “That…that’s not true.” I looked up at Lorren. “He let me in. He sent Fela away, then let me in.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What?” Ambrose gaped at me, momentarily speechless. For all that I didn’t like him, I must give him credit for a masterful performance. “Why in God’s name would I do that?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Because I embarrassed you in front of Fela,” I said. “He sold me the candle, too.” I shook my head trying to clear my head. “No, he gave it to me.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose’s expression was amazed. “Look at him.” He laughed. “The little cocker is drunk or something.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I was just whipped!” I protested. My voice sounded shrill in my own ears.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Enough!” Lorren shouted, looming over us like a pillar of anger. The scrivs went pale at the sound of him.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lorren turned away from me, and made a brief, contemptuous gesture toward the desk. “Re’lar Ambrose is officially remanded for laxity in his duty.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What?” Ambrose’s indignant tone wasn’t feigned this time.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lorren frowned at him, and Ambrose closed his mouth. Turning to me, he said, “E’lir Kvothe is banned from the Archives.” He made a sweeping gesture with the flat of his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I tried to think of something I could say in my defense. “Master, I didn’t mean-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lorren rounded on me. His expression, always so calm before, was filled with such a cold, terrible anger that I took a step away from him without meaning to. “You</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> mean?</span></span><span class="calibre6">” he said. “I care nothing for your</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> intentions,</span></span><span class="calibre6"> E’lir Kvothe, deceived or otherwise. All that matters is the reality of your actions. Your hand held the fire. Yours is the blame. That is the lesson all adults must learn.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I looked down at my feet, tried desperately to think of something I could say. Some proof I could offer. My leaden thoughts were still plodding along when Lorren strode out of the room.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I don’t see why I should be punished for his stupidity,” Ambrose groused to the other scrivs as I made my way numbly to the door. I made the mistake of turning around and looking at him. His expression was serious, carefully controlled.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But his eyes were vastly amused, full of laughter. “Honestly boy,” he said to me. “I don’t know what you were thinking. You’d think a member of the Arcanum would have more sense.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I made my way to the Mess, the wheels of my thoughts turning slowly as I plodded along. I fumbled my meal chit into one of the dull tin trays and collected a portion of steamed pudding, a sausage, and some of the ever-present beans. I looked dully around the room until I spotted Simmon and Manet sitting in their usual place at the northeast corner of the hall.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I drew a fair amount of attention as I walked to the table. Understandable, as it was scarcely two hours since I’d been tied to the pennant pole and publicly lashed. I heard someone whisper, “…didn’t bleed when they whipped him. I was there. Not one drop.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was the nahlrout, of course. It had kept me from bleeding. It had seemed like such a good idea at the time. Now it seemed petty and foolish. Ambrose would never have managed to gull me so easily if my naturally suspicious nature hadn’t been fuddled. I’m sure I could have found some way to explain things to Lorren if I’d had my wits about me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">As I made my way to the far corner of the room, I realized the truth. I had traded away my access to the Archives in exchange for a little notoriety.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Still, there was nothing to do but make the best of it. If a bit of reputation was all I had to show for this debacle, I’d have to do my best to build on it. I kept my shoulders straight as I made my way across the room to Simmon and Manet and set down my food.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“There’s no such thing as a stack fee, is there?” I asked quietly as I slid into my seat, trying not to grimace at the pain across my back.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Sim looked at me blankly. “Stack fee?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Manet chortled into his bowl of beans. “It’s been a few years since I heard that. Back when I worked as a scriv we’d trick the first-termers into giving us a penny to use the Archives. Called it a stack fee.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Sim gave him a disapproving look. “That’s horrible.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Manet held up his hands defensively in front of his face. “Just a little harmless fun.” Manet looked me over. “Is that what your long face is for? Somebody cull you for a copper?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I shook my head. I wasn’t going to announce that Ambrose had tricked me out of a whole talent. “Guess who just got banned from the Archives?” I said gravely as I tore the crust off my bread and dropped it into my beans.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">They looked at me blankly. After a moment Simmon took the obvious guess. “Ummm…you?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded and began to spoon up my beans. I wasn’t really hungry, but I hoped a little food in my stomach might help shake off the sluggishness of the nahlrout. Besides, it went against my nature to pass up an opportunity for a meal.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You got suspended on your first day?” Simmon said. “That’s going to make studying your Chandrian folklore a whole lot harder.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I sighed. “You could say that.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“How long did he suspend you for?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He said</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> banned,</span></span><span class="calibre6">” I answered. “He didn’t mention a time limit.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Banned?” Manet looked up at me. “He hasn’t banned anyone in a dozen years. What’d you do? Piss on a book?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Some of the scrivs found me inside with a candle.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Merciful Tehlu.” Manet lay down his fork, his expression serious for the first time. “Old Lore must have been furious.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Furious is exactly the right word,” I said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What possessed you to go in there with an open flame?” Simmon asked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I couldn’t afford a hand lamp,” I said. “So the scriv at the desk gave me a candle instead.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He didn’t,” Sim said. “No scriv would…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hold on,” Manet said. “Was this a dark-haired fellow? Well-dressed? Severe eyebrows?” He made an exaggerated scowl.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded tiredly. “Ambrose. We met yesterday. Got off on the wrong foot.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He’s hard to avoid,” Manet said carefully, with a significant look to the people sitting around us. I noticed that more than a few were casually listening to our conversation. “Someone should have warned you to keep clear of him,” he added in a softer tone.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“God’s mother,” Simmon said. “Of all the people you don’t want to start a pissing contest with…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Well, it’s been started,” I said. I was starting to feel a little more like myself again, less cotton-headed and weary. Either the side effects of the nahlrout were fading, or my anger was slowly burning away the haze of exhaustion. “He’ll find out I can piss along with the best of them. He’ll wish he’d never met me, let alone meddled with my affairs.” Simmon looked a little nervous. “You really shouldn’t threaten other students,” he said with a little laugh, as if trying to pass my comment off as a joke. More softly, he said. “You don’t understand. Ambrose is heir to a barony off in Vintas.” He hesitated, looking to Manet. “Lord, how do I even start?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Manet leaned forward and spoke in more confidential tones as well. “He’s not one of those nobility who dabble here for a term or two then leave. He’s been for years, climbed his way up to Re’lar. He’s not some seventh son either. He’s the firstborn heir. And his father is one of the twelve most powerful men in all of Vintas.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Actually he’s sixteenth in the peerage,” Sim said matter-of-factly. “You’ve got the royal family, the prince regents, Maer Alveron, Duchess Samista, Aculeus and Meluan Lackless…” He trailed off under Manet’s glare.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He has money,” Manet said simply. “And the friends that money buys.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And people who want to curry favor with his father,” Simmon added.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The point is,” Manet said seriously, “you don’t want to cross him. Back in his first year here, one of the alchemists got on Ambrose’s bad side. Ambrose bought his debt from the moneylender in Imre. When the fellow couldn’t pay, they clapped him into debtor’s prison.” Manet tore a piece of bread in half and daubed butter onto it. “By the time his family got him out he had lung consumption. Fellow was a wreck. Never came back to his studies.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And the masters just let this happen?” I demanded.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“All perfectly legal,” Manet said, still keeping his voice low. “Even so, Ambrose wasn’t so silly that he bought the fellow’s debt</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> himself.</span></span><span class="calibre6">” Manet made a dismissive gesture. “He had someone else do that, but he made sure everyone knew he was responsible.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And there was Tabetha,” Sim said darkly. “She made all that noise about how Ambrose had promised to marry her. She just disappeared.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">This certainly explained why Fela had been so hesitant to offend him. I made a placating gesture to Sim. “I’m not threatening anyone,” I said innocently, pitching my voice so anyone who was listening could easily hear. “I’m just quoting one of my favorite pieces of literature. It’s from the fourth act of</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Daeonica</span></span><span class="calibre6"> where Tarsus says:</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“Upon him I will visit famine and a fire.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Till all around him desolation rings</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">And all the demons in the outer dark</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Look on amazed and recognize</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">That vengeance is the business of a man.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a moment of stunned silence nearby. It spread a bit farther through the Mess than I’d expected. Apparently I’d underestimated the number of people who were listening. I turned my attention back to my meal and decided to let it go for now. I was tired, and I hurt, and I didn’t particularly want any more trouble today.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You won’t need this piece of information for a while,” Manet said quietly after a long period of silence. “What with being banned from the Archives and all. Still, I’m supposing you’d rather know…” He cleared his throat uncomfortably. “You don’t have to buy a hand lamp. You just sign them out at the desk and return them when you’re done.” He looked at me as if anxious about what sort of reaction the information might provoke.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded wearily. I’d been right before. Ambrose wasn’t half the bastard I thought he was. He was ten times the bastard.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_47"></div></div>
