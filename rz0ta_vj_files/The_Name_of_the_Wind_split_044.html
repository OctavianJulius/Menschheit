I guessed from the student’s reactions that Master Hemme was not particularly well loved. As I sat on a stone bench outside the Mews, passing students smiled in my direction. Others waved or gave laughing thumbs-up.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">While I enjoyed the notoriety, a cold anxiety was slowly growing in my gut. I’d made an enemy of one of the nine masters. I needed to know how much trouble I was in.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Dinner in the Mess was brown bread with butter, stew, and beans. Manet was there, his wild hair making him look like a great white wolf. Simmon and Sovoy groused idly about the food, making grim speculations as to what manner of meat was in the stew. To me, less than a span away from the streets of Tarbean, it was a marvelous meal indeed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Nevertheless, I was rapidly losing my appetite in the face of what I was hearing from my friends.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Don’t get me wrong,” Sovoy said. “You’ve got a great weighty pair on you. I’ll never call</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> that</span></span><span class="calibre6"> into question. But still…” he gestured with his spoon. “They’re going to string you up for this.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“If he’s lucky,” Simmon said. “I mean, we are talking about malfeasance here, aren’t we?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s not a big deal,” I said with more assurance than I felt. “I gave him a little bit of a hotfoot, that’s all.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Any harmful sympathy falls under malfeasance.” Manet pointed at me with his piece of bread, his wild, grizzled eyebrows arching seriously over his nose. “You’ve got to pick your battles, boy. Keep your head down around the masters. They can make your life a real hell once you get into their bad books.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He started it,” I said sullenly though a mouthful of beans.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">A young boy jogged up to the table, breathless. “You’re Kvothe?” He asked, looking me over.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded, my stomach suddenly turning over.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“They want you in the Masters’ Hall.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Where is it?” I asked. “I’ve only been here a couple of days.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Can one of you show him?” the boy asked, looking around at the table. “I’ve got to go tell Jamison I found him.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll do it,” Simmon said pushing away his bowl. “I’m not hungry anyway.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Jamison’s runner boy took off, and Simmon started to get to his feet.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hold on,” I said, pointing to my tray with my spoon. “I’m not finished here.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Simmon’s expression was anxious. “I can’t believe you’re eating,” he said. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">I</span></span><span class="calibre6"> can’t eat. How can you eat?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m hungry,” I said. “I don’t know what’s waiting in the Masters’ Hall, but I’m guessing I’d rather have a full stomach for it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You’re going on the horns,” Manet said. “It’s the only reason they’d call you there at this time of night.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I didn’t know what he meant by that, but I didn’t want to advertise my ignorance to everyone in the room. “They can wait until I’m done.” I took another bite of stew.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Simmon returned to his seat and poked idly at his food. Truth be told, I wasn’t really hungry anymore, but it galled me to be pulled away from a meal after all the times I’d been hungry in Tarbean.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When Simmon and I finally got to our feet, the normal clamor in the Mess quieted as folk watched us leave. They knew where I was headed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Outside, Simmon put his hands in his pockets and headed roughly in the direction of Hollows. “All kidding aside, you’re in a good bit of trouble, you know.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I was hoping Hemme would be embarrassed and keep quiet about it,” I admitted. “Do they expel many students?” I tried to make it sound like a joke.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“There hasn’t been anyone this term,” Sim said with his shy, blue-eyed smile. “But it’s only the second day of classes. You might set some sort of record.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“This isn’t funny,” I said, but found myself wearing a grin regardless. Simmon could always make me smile, no matter what was going on.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Sim led the way, and we reached Hollows far too soon for my liking. Simmon raised a hand in a hesitant farewell as I opened the door and made my way inside.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I was met by Jamison. He oversaw everything that wasn’t under direct control of the masters: the kitchens, the laundry, the stables, the stockrooms. He was nervous and birdlike. A man with the body of a sparrow and the eyes of a hawk.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Jamison escorted me into a large windowless room with a familiar crescent-shaped table. The Chancellor sat at the center, as he had during admissions. The only real difference was that this table was not elevated, and the seated masters were close to eye level with me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The eyes I met were not friendly. Jamison escorted me to the front of the crescent table. Seeing it from this angle made me understand the references to being “on the horns.” Jamison retreated to a smaller table of his own, dipping a pen.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor steepled his fingers and spoke without preamble. “On the fourth of Caitelyn, Hemme called the masters together.” Jamison’s pen scratched across a piece of paper, occasionally dipping back into the inkwell at the top of the desk. The Chancellor continued formally, “Are all the masters present?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Physicker,” said Arwyl.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Archivist,” said Lorren, his face impassive as ever.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Arithmetician,” Brandeur said, cracking his knuckles absently.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Artificer,” grumbled Kilvin without looking up from the tabletop.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Alchemist,” said Mandrag.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Rhetorician,” Hemme’s face was fierce and red.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Sympathist,” said Elxa Dal.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Namer.” Elodin actually smiled at me. Not just a perfunctory curling of the lips, but a warm, toothy grin. I drew a bit of a shaky breath, relieved that at least one person present didn’t seem eager to hang me up by my thumbs.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And Master Linguist,” said the Chancellor. “All eight…” He frowned. “Sorry. Strike that. All</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> nine</span></span><span class="calibre6"> masters are present. Present your grievance, Master Hemme.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme did not hesitate. “Today, first-term student Kvothe, not of the Arcanum, did perform sympathetic bindings on me with malicious intent.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Two grievances are recorded against Kvothe by Master Hemme,” The Chancellor said sternly, not taking his eyes away from me. “First grievance, unauthorized use of sympathy. What is the proper discipline for this, Master Archivist?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“For unauthorized use of sympathy leading to injury, the offending student will be bound and whipped a number of times, not less than two nor more than ten, singly, across the back.” Lorren said it as if reading off directions for a recipe.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Number of lashes sought?” The Chancellor looked at Hemme.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme paused to consider. “Five.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I felt the blood drain from my face and I forced myself to take a slow, deep breath through my nose to calm myself.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Does any master object to this?” The Chancellor looked around the table, but all mouths were silent, all eyes were stern. “The second grievance: malfeasance. Master Archivist?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Four to fifteen single lashes and expulsion from the University.” Lorren said in a level voice.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Lashes sought?</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme stared directly at me. “Eight.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Thirteen lashes and expulsion. A cold sweat swept over me and I felt nausea in the pit of my stomach. I had known fear before. In Tarbean it was never far away. Fear kept you alive. But I had never before felt such a desperate helplessness. A fear not just for my body being hurt, but for my entire life being ruined. I began to get light-headed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Do you understand these grievances set against you?” The Chancellor asked sternly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I took a deep breath. “Not exactly, sir.” I hated the way my voiced sounded, tremulous and weak.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor held up a hand and Jamison lifted his pen from the paper. “It is against the laws of the University for a student who is not a member of the Arcanum to use sympathy without permission from a master.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">His expression darkened. “And it is always,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> always,</span></span><span class="calibre6"> expressly forbidden to cause harm with sympathy, especially to a master. A few hundred years ago arcanists were hunted down and burned for things of that sort. We do not tolerate that sort of behavior here.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I heard a hard edge creep into the Chancellor’s voice, only then did I sense how truly angry he was. He took a deep breath. “Now, do you understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded shakily.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He made another motion to Jamison, who set his pen back to the paper. “Do you, Kvothe, understand these grievances set against you?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Yes, sir.” I said, as steadily as I could. Everything seemed too bright, and my legs were trembling slightly. I tried to force them to be still, but it only seemed to make them shake all the more.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Do you have anything to say in your defense?” the Chancellor asked curtly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I just wanted to leave. I felt the stares of the masters bearing down on me. My hands were wet and cold. I probably would have shaken my head and slunk from the room had the Chancellor not spoken again.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Well?” The Chancellor repeated testily. “No defense?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The words struck a chord in me. They were the same words that Ben had used a hundred times as he drilled me endlessly in argument. His words came back, admonishing me:</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> What? No defense? Any student of mine must be able to defend his ideas against an attack. No matter how you spend your life, your wit will defend you more often than a sword. Keep it sharp!</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I took another deep breath, closed my eyes and concentrated. After a long moment, I felt the cool impassivity of the Heart of Stone surround me. My trembling stopped.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I opened my eyes and heard my own voice say, “I had permission for my use of sympathy, sir.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor gave me a long, hard look before saying, “What?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I held the Heart of Stone around me like a calming mantle. “I had permission from Master Hemme, both express and implied.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The masters stirred in their seats, puzzled.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor looked far from pleased. “Explain yourself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I approached Master Hemme after his first lecture and told him I was already familiar with the concepts he had discussed. He told me we would discuss it the next day.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“When he arrived for class the next day, he announced that I would be giving the lecture in order to demonstrate the principles of sympathy. After observing what materials were available, I gave the class the first demonstration my master gave me.” Not true, of course. As I’ve already mentioned, my first lesson involved a handful of iron drabs. It was a lie, but a plausible lie.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Judging by the masters’ expressions, this was news to them. Somewhere deep in the Heart of Stone, I relaxed, glad that the master’s irritation was based on Hemme’s angrily abridged version of the truth.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You gave a demonstration before the class?” the Chancellor asked before I could continue. He glanced at Hemme, then back to me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I played innocent. “Just a simple one. Is that unusual?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It is a little odd,” he said, looking at Hemme. I could sense his anger again, but this time it didn’t seem to be directed at me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I thought it might be the way you proved your knowledge of the material and moved to a more advanced class,” I said innocently. Another lie, but again, plausible.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elxa Dal spoke up, “What did the demonstration involve?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“A wax doll, a hair from Hemme’s head, and a candle. I would have picked a different example, but my materials were limited. I thought that might be another part of the test, making do with what you were given.” I shrugged again. “I couldn’t think of any other way to demonstrate all three laws with the materials on hand.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor looked at Hemme. “Is what the boy says true?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme opened his mouth as if he would deny it, then apparently remembered that an entire classroom full of students had witnessed the exchange. He said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Damn it, Hemme,” Elxa Dal burst out. “You let the boy make a simulacra of you, then bring him here on malfeasance?” He spluttered. “You deserve worse than you got.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“E’lir Kvothe could not have hurt him with just a candle,” Kilvin muttered. He gave his fingers a puzzled look, as if he were working something out in his head. “Not with hair and wax. Maybe blood and clay…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Order.” The Chancellor’s voice was too quiet to be called a shout, but it carried the same authority. He shot looks at Elxa Dal and Kilvin. “Kvothe, answer Master Kilvin’s question.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I made a second binding between the candle and a brazier to illustrate the Law of Conservation.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Kilvin didn’t look up from his hands. “Wax and hair?” He grumbled as if not entirely satisfied with my explanation.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I gave a half-puzzled, half-embarrassed look and said, “I don’t understand it myself, sir. I should have gotten ten percent transference at best. It shouldn’t have been enough to blister Master Hemme, let alone burn him.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I turned to Hemme. “I really didn’t mean any harm, sir,” I said in my best distraught voice. “It was just supposed to be a bit of a hotfoot to make you jump. The fire hadn’t been going more than five minutes, and I didn’t imagine that a fresh fire at ten percent could hurt you.” I even wrung my hands a little, every bit the distraught student. It was a good performance. My father would have been proud.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Well it did,” Hemme said bitterly. “And where is the damn mommet anyway? I demand you return it at once!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m afraid I can’t, sir. I destroyed it. It was too dangerous to leave lying around.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme gave me a shrewd look. “It’s of no real concern,” he muttered.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor took up the reins again. “This changes things considerably. Hemme, do you still set grievance against Kvothe?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme glared and said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I move to strike both grievances,” Arwyl said. The physicker’s old voice coming as a bit of a surprise. “If Hemme set him in front of the class, he gave permission. And it isn’t malfeasance if you give him your hair and watch him stick it on the mommet’s head.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I expected him to have more control over what he was doing,” Hemme said, shooting a venomous look at me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s not malfeasance,” Arwyl said doggedly, glaring at Hemme from behind his spectacles, the grandfatherly lines on his face forming a fierce scowl.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It would fall under reckless use of sympathy,” Lorren interjected coolly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Is that a motion to strike the previous two grievances and replace them with reckless use of sympathy?” asked the Chancellor, trying to regain a semblance of formality.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Aye,” said Arwyl, still glaring fearsomely at Hemme through his spectacles.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“All for the motion?” The Chancellor said,</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a chorus of ayes from everyone but Hemme.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Against?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme remained silent.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Master Archivist, what is the discipline for reckless use of sympathy?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“If one is injured by reckless use of sympathy, the offending student will be whipped, singly, no more than seven times across the back.” I wondered what book Master Lorren was reciting from.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Number of lashes sought?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme looked at the other masters’ faces, realizing the tide had turned against him. “My foot is blistered halfway to my knee,” he gritted. “Three lashes.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor cleared his throat. “Does any master oppose this action?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Aye,” Elxa Dal and Kilvin said together.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Who wishes to suspend the discipline? Vote by show of hands.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elxa Dal, Kilvin, and Arwyl raised their hands at once, followed by the Chancellor. Mandrag kept his hand down, as did Lorren, Brandeur, and Hemme. Elodin grinned at me cheerily, but did not raise his hand. I kicked myself for my recent trip to the Archives and the bad impression it made on Lorren. If not for that he might have tipped things in my favor.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Four and a half in favor of suspending punishment,” the Chancellor said after a pause. “The discipline stands: three lashes to be served tomorrow, the third of Equis, at noon.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">As I was deep into the Heart of Stone, all I felt was a slight analytical curiosity about what it would be like to be publicly whipped. All the masters showed signs of preparing to stand and leave, but before things could be called to a close I spoke up, “Chancellor?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He took a deep breath and let it out in a gush. “Yes?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“During my admission, you said that my admittance to the Arcanum was granted, contingent upon proof that I had mastered the basic principles of sympathy.” I quoted him nearly word for word. “Does this constitute proof?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Both Hemme and the Chancellor opened their mouths to say something. Hemme was louder. “Look here, you little cocker!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hemme!” the Chancellor snapped. Then he turned to me, “I’m afraid proof of mastery requires more than a simple sympathetic binding.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“A double binding,” Kilvin corrected gruffly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin spoke, seeming to startle everyone at the table. “I can think of students currently enrolled in the Arcanum who would be hard pressed to complete a double binding, let alone draw enough heat to ‘blister a man’s foot to the knee.’” I had forgotten how Elodin’s light voice moved through the deep places in your chest when he spoke. He smiled happily at me again.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a moment of quiet reflection.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“True enough,” admitted Elxa Dal, giving me a close look.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The Chancellor looked down at the empty table for a minute. Then he shrugged, looked up, and gave a surprisingly jaunty smile. “All in favor of admitting first-term student Kvothe’s reckless use of sympathy as proof of mastery of the basic principles of sympathy vote by show of hands.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Kilvin and Elxa Dal raised their hands together. Arwyl added his a moment later. Elodin waved. After a pause, the Chancellor raised his hand as well, saying “Five and a half in favor of Kvothe’s admission to the Arcanum. Motion passed. Meeting dismissed. Tehlu shelter us, fools and children all.” He said the last very softly as he rested his forehead against the heel of his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hemme stormed out of the room with Brandeur in tow. Once they were through the door I heard Brandeur ask, “Weren’t you wearing a gram?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“No, I wasn’t.” Hemme snapped. “And don’t take that tone with me, as if this were my fault. You might as well blame someone stabbed in an alley for not wearing armor.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“We should all take precautions.” Brandeur said, placatingly. “You know as well as-” Their voices were cut off with the sound of a door closing.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Kilvin stood and shrugged his shoulders, stretching. Looking over to where I stood, he scratched his bushy beard with both hands, a thoughtful look on his face, then strode over to where I stood. “Do you have your sygaldry yet, E’lir Kvothe?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I looked at him blankly. “Do you mean runes, sir? I’m afraid not.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Kilvin ran his hands through his beard, thoughtfully. “Do not bother with the Basic Artificing class you have signed for. Instead you will come to my workroom tomorrow. Noon.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m afraid I have another appointment at noon, Master Kilvin.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hmmm. Yes.” He frowned. “First bell, then.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m afraid the boy will be having an appointment with my folk shortly after the whipping, Kilvin,” Arwyl said with a glimmer of amusement in his eyes. “Have someone bring you to the Medica afterward, son. We’ll stitch you back together.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Thank you, sir.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Arwyl nodded and made his way out of the room.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Kilvin watched him go, then turned to look at me. “My workshop. Day after tomorrow. Noon.” The tone of his voice implied that it wasn’t really a question.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I would be honored, Master Kilvin.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He grunted in response and left with Elxa Dal.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">That left me alone with the still-seated Chancellor. We stared at each other while the sound of footsteps faded in the hallway. I brought myself back up out of the Heart of Stone and felt a tangle of anticipation and fear at everything that had just happened.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m sorry to be so much trouble so soon, sir.” I offered hesitantly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Oh?” he said. His expression considerably less stern now that we were alone. “How long had you intended to wait?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“At least a span, sir.” My brush with disaster had left me feeling giddy with relief. I felt an irrepressible grin bubble onto my face.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“At least a span,” he muttered. The Chancellor put his face into his hands and rubbed, then looked up and surprised me with a wry smile. I realized he wasn’t particularly old when his face wasn’t locked in a stern expression. Probably only on the far side of forty. “You don’t look like someone who knows he’s going to be whipped tomorrow,” he observed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I pushed the thought aside. “I imagine I’ll heal, sir.” He gave me an odd look, it took me a while to recognize it as the one I’d grown accustomed to in the troupe. He opened his mouth to speak, but I jumped on the words before he could say them. “I’m not as young as I look, sir. I know it. I just wish other people knew it, too.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I imagine they will before too long.” He gave me a long look before pushing himself up from the table. He held out a hand. “Welcome to the Arcanum.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I shook his hand solemnly and we parted ways. I worked my way outside and was surprised to see that it was full night. I breathed in a lungful of sweet spring air and felt my grin resurface.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then someone touched me on the shoulder. I jumped fully two feet into the air and narrowly avoided falling on Simmon in the howling, scratching, biting blur that had been my only method of defense in Tarbean.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He took a step back, startled by the expression on my face.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I tried to slow my pounding heart. “Simmon. I’m sorry. I’m just…try to make a little noise around me. I startle easily.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Me too,” he murmured shakily, wiping a hand across his forehead. “I can’t really blame you, though. Riding the horns will do that to the best of us. How did things go?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m to be whipped and admitted to the Arcanum.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He looked at me curiously, trying to see if I was making a joke. “I’m sorry? Congratulations?” He made a shy smile at me. “Do I buy you a bandage or a beer?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I smiled back. “Both.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">By the time I got back to the fourth floor of the Mews, rumor of my non-expulsion and admission into the Arcanum had spread ahead of me. I was greeted by a smattering of applause from my bunkmates. Hemme was not well loved. Some of my bunkmates offered awed congratulations while Basil made a special point of coming forward to shake my hand.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I had just climbed up to a sitting position on my bunk and was explaining to Basil the difference between a single whip and a six-tail when the third-floor steward came looking for me. He instructed me to pack up my things, explaining that Arcanum students were located in the west wing.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Everything I owned still fit neatly into my travelsack, so it was no great chore. As the steward led me away there was a chorus of good-byes from my fellow first-term students.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The west wing bunks were similar to those I had left behind. It was still rows of narrow beds, but here they weren’t stacked two high. Each bed had a small wardrobe and desk in addition to a trunk. Nothing fancy, but definitely a step up.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The biggest difference was in the attitudes of my bunkmates. There were scowls and glares, though for the most part I was pointedly ignored. It was a chilly reception, especially in light of the welcome I had just received from my non-Arcanum bunkmates.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was easy to understand why. Most students attend the University for several terms before being admitted into the Arcanum. Everyone here had worked their way up through the ranks the hard way. I hadn’t.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Only about three quarters of the bunks were full. I picked one in the back corner, away from the others. I hung my one extra shirt and my cloak in the wardrobe and put my travelsack in the trunk at the foot of my bed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I lay down and stared at the ceiling. My bunk lay outside the light of the other student’s candles and sympathy lamps. I was finally a member of the Arcanum, in some ways exactly where I had always wanted to be.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_44"></div></div>
