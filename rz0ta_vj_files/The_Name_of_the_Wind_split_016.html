When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was evening, and the troupe was camped by the side of the road. Abenthy had given me a new piece of sympathy to practice: The Maxim of Variable Heat Transferred to Constant Motion, or something pretentious like that.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was tricky, but it had fallen into place like a puzzle piece fitting. It had taken about fifteen minutes, and from Abenthy’s tone I guessed he had expected it to take three or four hours at least.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So I went looking for him. Partly to get my next lesson, and partly so that I could be just a little bit smug.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I tracked him down to my parent’s wagon. I heard the three of them long before I saw them. Their voices were just murmurs, the distant music that a conversation makes when it’s too dim for words. But as I was coming close I heard one word clearly:</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Chandrian.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I pulled up short when I heard that. Everyone in the troupe knew my father was working on a song. He’d been teasing old stories and rhymes from townsfolk for over a year wherever we stopped to play.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">For months it was stories about Lanre. Then he started gathering old faerie stories too, legends about bogies and shamble-men. Then he began to ask questions about the Chandrian…</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">That was months ago. Over the last half year he had asked more about the Chandrian and less about Lanre, Lyra, and the rest. Most songs my father set to writing were finished in a single season, while this one was stretching toward its second year.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">You should know this as well, my father never let word or whisper of a song be heard before it was ready to play. Only my mother was allowed into his confidence, as her hand was always in any song he made. The cleverness in the music was his. The best words were hers.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When you wait a few span or month to hear a finished song, the anticipation adds savor. But after a year excitement begins to sour. By now, a year and a half had passed and folk were almost mad with curiosity. This occasionally led to hard words when someone was caught wandering a little too close to our wagon while my father and mother were working.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So I moved closer to my parent’s fire, stepping softly. Eavesdropping is a deplorable habit, but I have developed worse ones since.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…much about them,” I heard Ben say. “But I’m willing.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m glad to talk with an educated man on the subject.” My father’s strong baritone was a contrast to Ben’s tenor. “I’m weary of these superstitious country folk, and the…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Someone added wood to the fire and I lost my father’s words in the crackling that followed. Stepping as quickly as I dared, I moved into the long shadow of my parent’s wagon.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…like I’m chasing ghosts with this song. Trying to piece together this story is a fool’s game. I wish I’d never started it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Nonsense,” my mother said. “This will be your best work, and you know it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“So you think there is an original story all the others stem from?” Ben asked. “A historical basis for Lanre?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“All the signs point to it,” my father said. “It’s like looking at a dozen grandchildren and seeing ten of them have blue eyes. You know the grandmother had blue eyes, too. I’ve done this before, I’m good at it. I wrote “Below the Walls” the same way. But…” I heard him sigh.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What’s the problem then?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The story’s older,” my mother explained. “It’s more like he’s looking at great-great-grandchildren.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And they’re scattered to the four corners,” my father groused. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">And</span></span><span class="calibre6"> when I finally do find one, it’s got five eyes: two greens, a blue, a brown, and a chartreuse. Then the next one has only one eye, and it changes colors. How am I supposed to draw conclusions from that?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben cleared his throat. “A disturbing analogy,” he said. “But you’re welcome to pick my brain about the Chandrian. I’ve heard a lot of stories over the years.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The first thing I need to know is how many there actually are,” my father said. “Most stories say seven, but even that’s conflicted. Some say three, others five, and in</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Felior’s Fall</span></span><span class="calibre6"> there are a full thirteen of them: one for each pontifet in Atur, and an extra for the capitol.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That I can answer,” Ben said. “Seven. You can hold to that with some certainty. It’s part of their name, actually.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Chaen</span></span><span class="calibre6"> means seven.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Chaen-dian</span></span><span class="calibre6"> means ‘seven of them.’ Chandrian.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I didn’t know that,” my father said. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Chaen.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> What language is that? Yllish?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Sounds like Tema,” my mother said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You’ve got a good ear,” Ben said to her. “It’s Temic, actually. Predates Tema by about a thousand years.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Well that simplifies things,” I heard my father say. “I wish I’d asked you a month ago. I don’t suppose you know why they do what they do?” I could tell by my father’s tone that he didn’t really expect an answer.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That’s the real mystery, isn’t it?” Ben chuckled. “I think that’s what makes them more frightening than the rest of the bogey-men you hear about in stories. A ghost wants revenge, a demon wants your soul, a shamble-man is hungry and cold. It makes them less terrible. Things we understand we can try to control. But Chandrian come like lightning from a clear blue sky. Just destruction. No rhyme or reason to it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“My song will have both,” my father said with grim determination. “I think I’ve dug up their reason, after all this while. I’ve teased it together from bits and pieces of story. That’s what’s so galling about this, to have the harder part of this done and have all these small specifics giving me such trouble.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You think you know?” Ben said curiously. “What’s your theory?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father gave a low chuckle. “Oh no Ben, you’ll have to wait with the others. I’ve sweated too long over this song to give away the heart of it before it’s finished.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I could hear the disappointment in Ben’s voice. “I’m sure this is all just an elaborate ruse to keep me traveling with you,” he groused. “I won’t be able to leave until I’ve heard the blackened thing.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Then help us finish it,” my mother said. “The Chandrian’s signs are another key piece of information we can’t nail down. Everyone agrees there are signs that warn of their presence, but nobody agrees on what they are.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Let me think…” Ben said. “Blue flame is obvious, of course. But I’d hesitate to attribute that to the Chandrian in particular. In some stories it’s a sign of demons. In others it’s fae creatures, or magic of any sort.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It shows bad air in mines, too,” my mother pointed out.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Does it?” my father asked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She nodded. “When a lamp burns with a blue haze you know there’s firedamp in the air.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Good lord, firedamp in a coal mine,” my father said. “Blow out your light and get lost in the black, or leave it burn and blow the whole place to flinders. That’s more frightening than any demon.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll also admit to the fact that certain arcanists occasionally use prepared candles or torches to impress gullible townsfolk,” Ben said, clearing his throat self-consciously.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother laughed. “Remember who you’re talking to, Ben. We’d never hold a little showmanship against a man. In fact, blue candles would be just the thing the next time we play</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Daeonica.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> If you happened to find a couple tucked away somewhere, that is.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll see what I can do,” Ben said, his voice amused. “Other signs…one of them is supposed to have eyes like a goat, or no eyes, or black eyes. I’ve heard that one quite a bit. I’ve heard that plants die when the Chandrian are around. Wood rots, metal rusts, brick crumbles…” He paused. “Though I don’t know if that’s several signs, or all one sign.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You begin to see the trouble I’m having,” my father said morosely. “And there’s still the question as to if they all share the same signs, or have a couple each.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ve told you,” my mother said, exasperated. “One sign for each of them. It makes the most sense.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“My lady wife’s favorite theory,” my father said. “But it doesn’t fit. In some stories the only sign is blue flame. In others you have animals going crazy and no blue flame. In others you have a man with black eyes</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> and</span></span><span class="calibre6"> animals going mad</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> and</span></span><span class="calibre6"> blue flame.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ve told you how to make sense of that,” she said, her irritated tone indicating they’d had this particular discussion before. “They don’t always have to be together. They could go out in threes or fours. If one of them makes fires dim, then it’ll look the same as if they</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> all</span></span><span class="calibre6"> made the fires dim. That would account for the differences in the stories. Different numbers and different signs depending on how they’re grouped together.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father grumbled something.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That’s a clever wife you’ve got there, Arl.” Ben spoke up, breaking the tension. “How much will you sell her for?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I need her for my work, unfortunately. But if you’re interested in a short-term rental, I’m sure we could arrange a reas-” There was a fleshy thump followed by a slightly pained chortle in my father’s baritone. “Any other signs that spring to mind?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“They’re supposed to be cold to the touch. Though how anyone could know that is beyond me. I’ve heard that fires don’t burn around them. Though that directly contradicts the blue flame. It could-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The wind picked up, stirring the trees. The rustling leaves drowned out what Ben said. I took advantage of the noise to creep a few steps closer.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…being ‘yoked to shadow,’ whatever that means,” I heard my father say as the wind died down.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben grunted. “I couldn’t say either. I heard a story where they were given away because their shadows pointed the wrong way, toward the light. And there was another where one of them was referred to as ‘shadow-hamed.’ It was ‘</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">something</span></span><span class="calibre6"> the shadow-hamed.’ Damned if I can remember the name though…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Speaking of names, that’s another point I’m having trouble with,” my father said. “There are a couple dozen I’ve collected that I’d appreciate your opinion on. The most-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Actually, Arl,” Ben interrupted, “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say them out loud. Names of people, that is. You can scratch them in the dirt if you’d like, or I could go fetch a slate, but I’d be more comfortable if you didn’t actually</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> say</span></span><span class="calibre6"> any of them. Better safe than sore, as they say.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a deep piece of silence. I stopped midsneak with one foot off the ground, afraid they’d heard me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Now don’t go looking at me like that, either of you,” Ben said testily.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“We’re just surprised, Ben,” came my mother’s gentle voice. “You don’t seem the superstitious type.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m not,” Ben said. “I’m careful. There’s a difference.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Of course,” my father said. “I’d never-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Save it for the paying customers, Arl,” Ben cut him off, irritation plain in his voice. “You’re too good an actor to show it, but I know perfectly well when someone thinks I’m daft.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I just didn’t expect it, Ben,” my father said apologetically. “You’re educated, and I’m so tired of people touching iron and tipping their beer as soon as I mention the Chandrian. I’m just reconstructing a story, not meddling with dark arts.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Well, hear me out. I like both of you too well to let you think of me as an old fool,” Ben said. “Besides, I have something to talk with you about later, and I’ll need you to take me seriously for that.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The wind continued to pick up, and I used the noise to cover my last few steps. I edged around the corner of my parents’ wagon and peered through a veil of leaves. The three of them were sitting around the campfire. Ben was sitting on a stump, huddled in his frayed brown cloak. My parents were opposite him, my mother leaning against my father, a blanket draped loosely around them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben poured from a clay jug into a leather mug and handed it to my mother. His breath fogged as he spoke. “How do they feel about demons off in Atur?” he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Scared.” My father tapped his temple. “All that religion makes their brains soft.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“How about off in Vintas?” Ben asked. “Fair number of them are Tehlins. Do they feel the same way?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother shook her head. “They think it’s a little silly. They like their demons metaphorical.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What are they afraid of at night in Vintas then?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The Fae,” my mother said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father spoke at the same time. “Draugar.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You’re both right, depending on which part of the country you’re in,” Ben said. “And here in the Commonwealth people laugh up their sleeves at both ideas.” He gestured at the surrounding trees. “But here they’re careful come autumn-time for fear of drawing the attention of shamble-men.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That’s the way of things,” my father said. “Half of being a good trouper is knowing which way your audience leans.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You still think I’ve gone cracked in the head,” Ben said, amused. “Listen, if tomorrow we pulled into Biren and someone told you there were shamble-men in the woods, would you believe them?” My father shook his head. “What if two people told you?” Another shake.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben leaned forward on his stump. “What if a dozen people told you, with perfect earnestness, that shamble-men were out in the fields, eating-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Of course I wouldn’t believe them,” my father said, irritated. “It’s ridiculous.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Of course it is,” Ben agreed, raising a finger. “But the real question is this: Would you go into the woods?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father sat very still and thoughtful for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben nodded. “You’d be a fool to ignore half the town’s warning, even though you don’t believe the same thing they do. If not shamble-men, what are you afraid of?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Bears.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Bandits.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Good sensible fears for a trouper to have,” Ben said. “Fears that townsfolk don’t appreciate. Every place has its little superstitions, and everyone laughs at what the folk across the river think.” He gave them a serious look. “But have either of you ever heard a humorous song or story about the Chandrian? I’ll bet a penny you haven’t.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother shook her head after a moment’s thought. My father took a long drink before joining her.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Now I’m not saying that the Chandrian are out there, striking like lightning from the clear blue sky. But folk everywhere are afraid of them. There’s usually a reason for that.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben grinned and tipped his clay cup, pouring the last drizzle of beer out onto the earth. “And names are strange things. Dangerous things.” He gave them a pointed look. “That I know for true</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> because</span></span><span class="calibre6"> I am an educated man. If I’m a mite superstitious too…” He shrugged. “Well, that’s my choice. I’m old. You have to humor me.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father nodded thoughtfully. “It’s odd I never noticed that everyone treats the Chandrian the same. It’s something I should’ve seen.” He shook his head as if to clear it. “We can come back to names later, I suppose. What was it you wanted to talk about?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I prepared to sneak off before I was caught, but what Ben said next froze me in place before I took a single step.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s probably hard to see, being his parents and all. But your young Kvothe is rather bright.” Ben refilled his cup, and held out the jug to my father, who declined it. “As a matter of fact, ‘bright’ doesn’t begin to cover it, not by half.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother watched Ben over the top of her mug. “Anyone who spends a little time with the boy can see that, Ben. I don’t see why anyone would make a point of it. Least of all, you.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I don’t think you really grasp the situation,” Ben said, stretching his feet almost into the fire. “How easily did he pick up the lute?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father seemed a little surprised by the sudden change of topic. “Fairly easily, why?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“How old was he?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father tugged thoughtfully at his beard for a moment. In the silence my mother’s voice was like a flute. “Eight.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Think back to when you learned to play. Can you remember how old you were? Can you remember the sort of difficulties you had?” My father continued to tug on his beard, but his face was more reflective now, his eyes far away.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Abenthy continued. “I’ll bet he learned each chord, each fingering after being shown just once, no stumbling, no complaining. And when he did make a mistake it was never more than once, right?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father seemed a little perturbed. “Mostly, but he did have trouble, just the same as anyone else. E chord. He had a lot of trouble with greater and diminished E.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother broke in softly. “I remember too, dear, but I think it was just his small hands. He was awfully young…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I bet it didn’t stall him for long,” Ben said quietly. “He does have marvelous hands; my mother would have called them magician’s fingers.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father smiled. “He gets them from his mother, delicate, but strong. Perfect for scrubbing pots, eh woman?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother swatted him, then caught one of his hands in her own and unfolded it for Ben to see. “He gets them from his father, graceful and gentle. Perfect for seducing young nobles’ daughters.” My father started to protest, but she ignored him. “With his eyes and those hands there won’t be a woman safe in all the world when he starts hunting after the ladies.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Courting, dear,” my father corrected gently.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Semantics,” she shrugged. “It’s all a chase, and when the race is done, I think I pity women chaste who run.” She leaned back against my father, keeping his hand in her lap. She tilted her head slightly and he took his cue, leaning in to kiss the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Amen,” Ben said, raising his mug in salute.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father put his other arm around her and gave her a squeeze. “I still don’t see what you’re getting at, Ben.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He does everything that way, quick as a whip, hardly ever makes mistakes. I’ll bet he knows every song you’ve ever sung to him. He knows more about what’s in my wagon than I do.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He picked up the jug and uncorked it. “It’s not just memorization though. He understands. Half the things I’ve been meaning to show him he’s already figured out for himself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben refilled my mother’s cup. “He’s eleven. Have you ever known a boy his age who talks the way he does? A great deal of it comes from living in such an enlightened atmosphere.” Ben gestured to the wagons. “But most eleven-year-olds’ deepest thoughts have to do with skipping stones, and how to swing a cat by the tail.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother laughed like bells, but Abenthy’s face was serious. “It’s true, lady. I’ve had older students that would have loved to do half as well.” He grinned. “If I had his hands, and one quarter his wit, I’d be eating off silver plates inside a year.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a lull. My mother spoke softly, “I remember when he was just a little baby, toddling around. Watching, always watching. With clear bright eyes that looked like they wanted to swallow up the world.” Her voice had a little quaver in it. My father put his arm around her and she rested her head on his chest.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The next silence was longer. I was considering sneaking away when my father broke it. “What is it you suggest we do?” His voice was a mix of mild concern and fatherly pride.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben smiled gently. “Nothing except to think about what options you might give him when the time comes. He will leave his mark on the world as one of the best.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The best what?” my father rumbled.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Whatever he chooses. If he stays here I don’t doubt he will become the next Illien.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father smiled. Illien is the troupers’ hero. The only truly famous Edema Ruh in all of history. All our oldest, best songs are his songs.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">What’s more, if you believed the stories, Illien reinvented the lute in his lifetime. A master luthier, Illien transformed the archaic, fragile, unwieldy court lute into the marvelous, versatile, seven-string trouper’s lute we use today. The same stories claim Illien’s own lute had eight strings in all.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Illien. I like that thought,” my mother said. “Kings coming from miles away to hear my little Kvothe play.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“His music stopping barroom brawls and border wars.” Ben smiled.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The wild women in his lap,” my father enthused, “laying their breasts on his head.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a moment of stunned silence. Then my mother spoke slowly, with an edge to her voice. “I think you mean ‘wild beasts laying their heads in his lap.’”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Do I?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben coughed and continued. “If he decides to become an arcanist, I bet he’ll have a royal appointment by the time he’s twenty-four. If he gets it into his head to be a merchant I don’t doubt he’ll own half the world by the time he dies.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father’s brows knitted together. Ben smiled and said, “Don’t worry about the last one. He’s too curious for a merchant.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben paused as if considering his next words very carefully. “He’d be accepted into the University, you know. Not for years, of course. Seventeen is about as young as they go, but I have no doubts about…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I missed the rest of what Ben said. The University! I had come to think of it in the same way most children think of the Fae court, a mythical place reserved for dreaming about. A school the size of a small town. Ten times ten thousand books. People who would know the answers to any question I could ever ask…</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was quiet when I turned my attention back to them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father was looking down at my mother, nestled under his arm. “How about it, woman? Did you happen to bed down with some wandering God a dozen years ago? That might solve our little mystery.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She swatted at him playfully, and a thoughtful look crossed her face. “Come to think of it, there was a night, about a dozen years ago, a man came to me. He bound me with kisses and cords of chorded song. He robbed me of my virtue and stole me away.” She paused, “But he didn’t have red hair. Couldn’t be him.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She smiled wickedly at my father, who appeared a little embarrassed. Then she kissed him. He kissed her back.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">That’s how I like to remember them today. I snuck away with thoughts of the University dancing in my head.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_16"></div></div>
