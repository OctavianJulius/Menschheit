However, as is often the case, especially for children, the anticipation proved much more exciting than the reality.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It would be wrong to say that I was disappointed with sympathy. But honestly, I</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> was</span></span><span class="calibre6"> disappointed. It was not what I expected magic to be.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was useful. There was no denying that. Ben used sympathy to make light for our shows. Sympathy could start a fire without flint or lift a heavy weight without cumbersome ropes and pulleys.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But the first time I’d seen him, Ben had somehow called the wind. That was no mere sympathy. That was storybook magic. That was the secret I wanted more than anything.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Spring thaw was well behind us and the troupe was riding through the forests and fields of the western Commonwealth. I was riding along, as per normal, in the front of Ben’s wagon. Summer was just deciding to make itself known again and everything was green and growing.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Things had been quiet for about an hour. Ben was drowsing with the reins held loosely in one hand when the wagon hit a stone and jarred us both out of our respective reveries.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben pulled himself more upright in his seat, and addressed me in a tone I had grown to think of as Have-I-Got-a-Puzzle-for-You. “How would you bring a kettle of water to a boil?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Looking around I saw a large boulder by the side of the road. I pointed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That stone should be warm from sitting in the sun. I’d bind it to the water in the kettle, and use the heat in the stone to bring the water to boil.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Stone to water isn’t very efficient,” Ben chided me. “Only about one part in fifteen would end up warming the water.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It would work.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ll grant you that. But it’s sloppy. You can do better, E’lir.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He then proceeded to shout at Alpha and Beta, a sign that he was in a genuine good mood. They took it as calmly as ever, in spite of the fact that he accused them of things I’m sure no donkey has ever willingly done, especially not Beta, who possessed impeccable moral character.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Stopping midtirade, he asked, “How would you bring down that bird?” He gestured to a hawk riding the air above a wheat field to the side of the road.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I probably wouldn’t. It’s done nothing to me.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hypothetically.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m saying that, hypothetically, I wouldn’t do it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben chuckled. “Point made, E’lir. Precisely</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> how</span></span><span class="calibre6"> wouldn’t you do it? Details please.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’d get Teren to shoot it down.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He nodded thoughtfully. “Good, good. However, it is a matter between you and the bird. That hawk,” he gestured indignantly, “has said something uncouth about your mother.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ah. Then my honor demands I defend her good name myself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Indeed it does.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Do I have a feather?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“No.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Tehlu hold and-” I bit off the rest of what I was going to say at his disapproving look. “You never make it easy, do you?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s an annoying habit I picked up from a student who was too clever for his own good.” He smiled. “What could you do even if you had a feather?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’d bind it to the bird and lather it with lye soap.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben furrowed his brow, such as it was. “What kind of binding?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Chemical. Probably second catalytic.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">A thoughtful pause. “Second catalytic…” He scratched at his chin. “To dissolve the oil that makes the feather smooth?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He looked up at the bird. “I’ve never thought of that,” he said with a kind of quiet admiration. I took it as a compliment.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Nevertheless,” he looked back to me, “you have no feather. How do you bring it down?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I thought for several minutes, but couldn’t think of anything. I decided to try and turn this into a different sort of lesson.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I would,” I said casually, “simply call the wind, and make it strike the bird from the sky.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben gave me a calculating look that told me he knew exactly what I was up to. “And how would you do that, E’lir?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I sensed he might be ready to finally tell me the secret he had been keeping all through the winter months. At the same time I was struck with an idea.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I drew in a deep breath and spoke the words to bind the air in my lungs to the air outside. I fixed the Alar firmly in my mind, put my thumb and forefinger in front of my pursed lips, and blew between them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a light puff of wind at my back that tousled my hair and caused the tarpaulin covering the wagon to pull taut for a moment. It might have been nothing more than a coincidence, but nevertheless, I felt an exultant smile overflow my face. For a second I did nothing but grin like a maniac at Ben, his face dull with disbelief.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then I felt something squeeze my chest, as if I was deep underwater.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I tried to draw a breath but couldn’t. Mildly confused, I kept trying. It felt as if I’d just fallen flat on my back and had the air driven from me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">All in a rush I realized what I had done. My body exploded into a cold sweat and I grabbed frantically at Ben’s shirt, pointing at my chest, my neck, my open mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben’s face turned from shocked to ashen as he looked at me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I realized how still everything was. Not a blade of grass was stirring. Even the sound of the wagon seemed muted, as if far off in the distance.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Terror screamed through my mind, drowning out any thought. I began to claw at my throat, ripping my shirt open. My heart thundered through the ringing in my ears. Pain stabbed through my straining chest as I gaped for air.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Moving more quickly than I had ever seen before, Ben grabbed me by the tatters of my shirt and sprang from the seat of the wagon. Landing in the grass by the side of the road, he dashed me to the ground with such a force that, if I’d had any air in my lungs, it would have been driven out of me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tears streaked my face as I thrashed blindly. I knew that I was going to die. My eyes felt hot and red. I raked madly at the earth with hands that were numb and cold as ice.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I was aware of someone shouting, but it seemed very far away. Ben kneeled above me, but the sky was getting dim behind him. He seemed almost distracted, as if he were listening to something I couldn’t hear.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then he looked at me, all I remember were his eyes, they seemed far away and filled with a terrible power, dispassionate and cold.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He looked at me. His mouth moved. He called the wind.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">A leaf in lightning, I shook. And the thunderclap was black.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The next thing I remember was Ben helping me to my feet. I was dimly aware of the other wagons stopping and curious faces peering at us. My mother came away from our wagon and Ben met her halfway, chuckling and saying something reassuring. I couldn’t make out the words as I was focused on breathing deep, in and out.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The other wagons trundled on, and I followed Ben mutely back to his wagon. He made a show of puttering around, checking the cords that held the tarpaulin tight. I collected my wits and was helping as best I could when the final wagon in the troupe passed us.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When I looked up, Ben’s eyes were furious. “What were you thinking?” he hissed. “Well? What? What were you thinking?” I’d never seen him like this before, his whole body drawn up into a tight knot of anger. He was shaking with it. He drew back his arm to strike me…then stopped. After a moment his hand fell to his side.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Moving methodically he checked the last couple of ropes and climbed back onto the wagon. Not knowing what else to do, I followed him.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben twitched the reins and Alpha and Beta tugged the wagon into motion. We were last in line now. Ben stared straight ahead. I fingered the torn front of my shirt. It was tensely silent.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">In hindsight, what I had done was glaringly stupid. When I bound my breath to the air outside, it made it impossible for me to breathe. My lungs weren’t strong enough to move that much air. I would have needed a chest like an iron bellows. I would have had as much luck trying to drink a river or lift a mountain.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">We rode for about two hours in an uncomfortable silence. The sun was brushing the tops of the trees when Ben finally drew in a deep breath and let it out in an explosive sigh. He handed me the reins.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When I looked back at him I realized for the first time how old he was. I had always known he was nearing his third score of years, but I’d never seen him look it before.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I lied to your mother back there, Kvothe. She saw the end of what happened and was worried about you.” His eyes didn’t move from the wagon ahead of ours as he spoke. “I told her we were working on something for a performance. She’s a good woman. She deserves better than lies.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">We rode on in an endless agony of silence, but it was still a few hours before sunset when I heard voices calling “Greystone!” down the line. The bump of our wagon turning onto the grass jostled Ben from his brooding.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He looked around and saw the sun was still in the sky. “Why are we stopping so early? Tree across the road?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Greystone.” I gestured up ahead to the slab of stone that loomed over the tops of the wagons ahead of us.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Every once in a while we run across one by the road.” I gestured again to the greystone peering over the tops of smaller trees by the roadside. Like most greystones it was a crudely hewn rectangle about a dozen feet tall. The wagons gathering around it seemed rather insubstantial compared to the stone’s solid presence. “I’ve heard them called standing stones, but I’ve seen a lot of them that weren’t standing, just lying on their sides. We always stop for the day when we find one, unless we’re in a terrible hurry.” I stopped, realizing I was babbling.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’ve known them by a different name. Waystones,” Ben said quietly. He looked old and tired. After a moment he asked, “Why do you stop when you find one?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“We just always do. It’s a break from the road.” I thought for a moment. “I think they’re supposed to be good luck.” I wished I had more to say to keep the conversation going, his interest piqued, but I couldn’t think of anything else.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I suppose they could be at that.” Ben guided Alpha and Beta into a spot on the far side of the stone, away from most of the other wagons. “Come back for dinner or soon afterward. We need to talk.” He turned without looking at me and began to unhitch Alpha from the wagon.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I’d never seen Ben in a mood like this before. Worried that I’d ruined things between us, I turned and ran to my parents’ wagon.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I found my mother sitting in front of a fresh fire, slowly adding twigs to build it up. My father sat behind her, rubbing her neck and shoulders. They both looked up at the sound of my feet running toward them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Can I eat with Ben tonight?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother looked up at my father, then back to me. “You shouldn’t make yourself a nuisance, dear.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He invited. If I go now, I can help him set up for the night.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She wiggled her shoulders, and my father started rubbing them again. She smiled at me. “Fair enough, but don’t keep him up until the wee hours.” She smiled at me. “Give me a kiss.” She held out her arms and I gave her a hug and a kiss.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father gave me a kiss too. “Let me have your shirt. It’ll give me something to do while your mother fixes dinner.” He skinned me out of it and fingered the torn edges. “This shirt is wholly holey, more than it has any right to be.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I started to stammer out an explanation but he waved it aside. “I know, I know, it was all for the greater good. Try to be more careful, or I’ll make you sew it yourself. There’s a fresh one in your trunk. Bring me needle and thread while you’re in there, if you’d be so kind.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I made a dash into the back of the wagon and drew on a fresh shirt. While I rummaged around for needle and thread I heard my mother singing:</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“In evening when the sun is setting fast,</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">I’ll watch for you from high above</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">The time for your return is long since past</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">But mine is ever-faithful love.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father answered:</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“In evening when the light is dying</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">My feet at last are homeward turning</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">The wind is through the willows sighing</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Please keep the hearthfire burning.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When I came out of the wagon, he had her in a dramatic dip and was giving her a kiss. I set the needle and thread next to my shirt and waited. It seemed like a good kiss. I watched with a calculating eye, dimly aware that at some point in the future I might want to kiss a lady. If I did, I wanted to do a decent job of it.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">After a moment my father noticed me and stood my mother back on her feet. “That will be ha’penny for the show, Master Voyeur,” he laughed. “What are you still here for, boy? I’ll bet you the same ha’penny that a question slowed you down.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Why do we stop for the greystones?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Tradition, my boy,” he said grandly, throwing his arms wide. “And superstition. They are one and the same, anyway. We stop for good luck and because everyone enjoys an unexpected holiday.” He paused. “I used to know a bit of poem about them. How did it go…?</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“Like a drawstone even in our sleep</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Standing stone by old road is the way</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">To lead you ever deeper into Fae.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Laystone as you lay in hill or dell</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Greystone leads to</span></span><span class="calibre6"> something something ‘ell’.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father stood for a second or two looking off into space and tugging at his lower lip. Finally he shook his head. “Can’t remember the end of that last line. Lord but I dislike poetry. How can anyone remember words that aren’t put to music?” His forehead creased with concentration as he mouthed the words silently to himself.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What’s a drawstone?” I asked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s an old name for loden-stones,” my mother explained. “They’re pieces of star-iron that draw all other iron toward themselves. I saw one years ago in a curiosity cabinet.” She looked up at my father who was still muttering to himself. “We saw the loden-stone in Peleresin, didn’t we?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hmmm? What?” The question jogged him out of his reverie. “Yes. Peleresin.” He tugged at his lip again and frowned. “Remember this, son, if you forget everything else. A poet is a musician who can’t sing. Words have to find a man’s mind before they can touch his heart, and some men’s minds are woeful small targets. Music touches their hearts directly no matter how small or stubborn the mind of the man who listens.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My mother made a slightly unladylike snort. “Elitist. You’re just getting old.” She gave a dramatic sigh. “Truly, all the more’s the tragedy; the second thing to go is a man’s memory.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father puffed up into an indignant pose but my mother ignored him and said to me, “Besides, the only tradition that keeps troupes by the greystone is laziness. The poem should run like this:</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“Whatever the season</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">That I’m on the road</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">I look for a reason</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Loden or laystone</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">To lay down my load.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My father had a dark glimmer in his eye as he moved behind her. “Old?” He spoke in a low voice as he began to rub her shoulders again. “Woman, I have a mind to prove you wrong.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She smiled a wry smile. “Sir, I have a mind to let you.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I decided to leave them to their discussion and started to scamper back to Ben’s wagon when I heard my father call out behind me, “Scales after lunch tomorrow? And the second act of</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Tinbertin?</span></span><span class="calibre6">”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Okay.” I burst into a jog.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When I got back to Ben’s wagon he had already unhitched Alpha and Beta and was rubbing them down. I started to set up the fire, surrounding dry leaves with a pyramid of progressively larger twigs and branches. When I was finished I turned to where Ben sat.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">More silence. I could almost see him picking out his words as he spoke. “How much do you know about your father’s new song?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“The one about Lanre?” I asked. “Not much. You know what he’s like. No one hears it until it’s finished. Not even me.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m not talking about the song itself,” Ben said. “The story behind it. Lanre’s story.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I thought about the dozens of stories I’d heard my father collect over the last year, trying to pick out the common threads. “Lanre was a prince,” I said. “Or a king. Someone important. He wanted to be more powerful than anyone else in the world. He sold his soul for power but then something went wrong and afterward I think he went crazy, or he couldn’t ever sleep again, or…” I stopped when I saw Ben shaking his head.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He didn’t sell his soul,” Ben said. “That’s just nonsense.” He gave a great sigh that seemed to leave him deflated. “I’m doing this all wrong. Never mind your father’s song. We’ll talk about it after he finishes it. Knowing Lanre’s story might give you some perspective.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben took a deep breath and tried again. “Suppose you have a thoughtless six-year-old. What harm can he do?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I paused, unsure what sort of answer he wanted. Straightforward would probably be best. “Not much.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Suppose he’s twenty, and still thoughtless, how dangerous is he?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I decided to stick with the obvious answers. “Still not much, but more than before.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What if you give him a sword?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Realization started to dawn on me, and I closed my eyes. “More, much more. I understand, Ben. Really I do. Power is okay, and stupidity is usually harmless. Power and stupidity together are dangerous.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I never said</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> stupid,</span></span><span class="calibre6">” Ben corrected me. “You’re clever. We both know that. But you can be thoughtless. A clever, thoughtless person is one of the most terrifying things there is. Worse, I’ve been teaching you some dangerous things.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ben looked at the fire I’d laid out, then picked up a leaf, mumbled a few words, and watched a small flame flicker into life in the center of the twigs and tinder. He turned to look at me. “You could kill yourself doing something as simple as that.” He gave a sickly grin. “Or looking for the name of the wind.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He started to say something else, then stopped and rubbed his face with his hands. He gave a great sigh that seemed to deflate him. When he took his hands away, his face was tired. “How old are you again?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Twelve next month.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He shook his head. “It’s so easy to forget that. You don’t act your age.” He poked at the fire with a stick, “I was eighteen when I began at the University,” he said. “I was twenty before I knew as much as you do now.” He stared into the fire. “I’m sorry Kvothe. I need to be alone tonight. I need to do some thinking.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded silently. I went to his wagon, gathered tripod and kettle, water and tea. I brought them back and quietly laid them beside Ben. He was still staring into the fire when I turned away.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Knowing my parents wouldn’t expect me back for a while, I headed into the forest. I had some thinking of my own to do. I owed Ben that much. I wished I could do more.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It took a full span of days before Ben was his normal, jovial self again. But even then things weren’t the same between us. We were still fast friends, but there was something between us, and I could tell he was consciously holding himself apart.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lessons ground to a near standstill. He halted my fledgling study of alchemy, limiting me to chemistry instead.
