It’s a dragon.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s not a dragon,” I said. “There’s no such thing as dragons.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Look at it!” she hissed at me. “It’s right there! Look at the huge Goddamn dragon!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s a draccus,” I said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It’s Goddamn huge,” Denna said with a tinge of hysteria in her voice. “It’s a Goddamn huge dragon and it’s going to come over here and eat us.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It doesn’t eat meat,” I said. “It’s an herbivore. It’s like a big cow.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Denna looked at me and started to laugh. Not hysterical laughter, but the helpless laugher of someone who’s just heard something so funny they can’t help but bubble over with it. She put her hands over her mouth and shook with it, the only sound was a low huffing that escaped through her fingers.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was another flash of blue fire from below. Denna froze midlaugh, then took her hands away from her mouth. She looked at me, her eyes wide, and spoke softly with a slight quaver in her voice, “Mooooo.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">We had both gone from terrified to safe so quickly that we were close to laughing from sheer relief anyway. So when she convulsed with laughter again, muffling it with her hands, I started to laugh too, my belly shaking as I tried not to make any noise. We lay there like two giggling children while below us the great beast grunted and snuffed around our fire, occasionally sending up gouts of flame.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">After a long several minutes, we regained control of ourselves. Denna wiped tears away from her eyes and drew a deep, shaky breath. She slid closer to me until the left side of her body was pressed close up against my right. “Listen,” she said softly as we both looked over the edge of the stone. “That thing does not graze,” she said. “It’s huge. It could never get enough food. And look at its mouth. Look at those teeth.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Exactly. They’re flat, not pointed. It eats trees. Whole trees. Look at how big it is. Where could it possibly find enough meat? It would have to eat ten deer every day. There’s no way it could survive!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She turned her head to look at me. “How the hell do you know this?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I read about it at the University,” I said. “A book called</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> The Mating Habits of the Common Draccus.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> It uses the fire in a mating display. It’s like a bird’s plumage.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You mean that that thing down there,” she groped for words, her mouth working silently for a moment, “is going to try and tup our campfire?” She looked for a moment as if she was going to burst into laughter again, but she drew a deep, shuddering breath instead, regaining her composure. “Now that’s something I have to see…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">We both felt a shudder in the stone underneath us, coming up from the ground below. At the same time, things grew noticeably darker.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Looking down, we saw the draccus rolling in the fire like a hog in a wallow. The ground shook as it wriggled around, crushing the fire underneath itself.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That thing must weigh…” Denna stalled out, shaking her head.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Maybe five tons,” I guessed. “Five at least.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It could come get us. It could push over these stones.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I don’t know about that,” I said, slapping the stone under my hand, trying to sound more certain than I really was. “These have been here for a long time. We’re safe.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">While rolling in our overlarge campfire, the draccus had scattered burning branches around the top of the hill. It now wandered to where a half-charred log lay smoldering in the grass. The draccus snuffed, then rolled, crushing the log into the earth. Then it came back to its feet, snuffed the log again, and ate it. It didn’t chew. It bolted the log whole, like a frog getting a cricket down into its gullet.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It did this several times, moving in a circle around the now largely extinguished fire. It snuffed, rolled on the burning pieces, then ate them after they were extinguished.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That makes sense, I suppose,” Denna said, watching it. “It starts fires and lives in the woods. If it didn’t have something in its head that made it want to put out fires, it wouldn’t survive very long.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That’s probably why it came here,” I said. “It saw our fire.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">After several minutes of snuffing and rolling, the draccus came back to the flat bed of coals that was all that remained of our fire. It circled it a few times, then walked over it and lay down. I cringed, but it just shifted back and forth like a hen settling into a nest. The hilltop below was now entirely dark except for the pale moonlight.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“How can I never have heard of these things?” Denna asked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“They’re very rare,” I said. “People tend to kill them because they don’t understand they’re relatively harmless. And they don’t reproduce very quickly. That one down there is probably two hundred years old, about as big as they get.” I marveled at it. “I bet there aren’t more than a couple hundred draccus that size in the whole world.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">We watched for another couple minutes, but there was no movement from below. Denna gave a jaw-popping yawn. “Gods, I’m exhausted. There’s nothing like the certain knowledge of your own death to tucker you out.” She rolled over onto her back, then onto her side, then back facing toward me, trying to get comfortable. “Lord it’s cold up here.” She shivered visibly. “I can see why it’s cuddled up on our fire.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“We could go down and get the blanket,” I suggested.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She snorted. “Not likely.” She shivered visibly, wrapping her arms around her chest.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Here,” I stood up and took off my cloak. “Wrap up in this. It’s not much, but it’s better than the bare stone.” I held it out to her. “I’ll watch you while you sleep and make sure you don’t fall off.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She stared at me for a long moment, and I half expected her to beg off. But after a moment she took it and wrapped it around herself. “You, Master Kvothe, certainly know how to show a girl a good time.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Wait until tomorrow,” I said. “I’m just getting started.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I sat there quietly, trying not to shiver, and eventually Denna’s breathing leveled off. I watched her sleep with the calm contentment of a boy who has no idea of how foolish he is, or what unexpected tragedies the following day will bring.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_80"></div></div>
