Despite the fact that I’d been searching out her face in every shadow and carriage window for days, the sight of her stunned me. I’d remembered the shape of her eyes, but not the weight of them. Their darkness, but not their depth. Her closeness pressed the breath out of my chest, as if I’d suddenly been thrust deep underwater.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I’d spent long hours thinking about how this meeting might go. I had played the scene a thousand times in my mind. I feared she would be distant, aloof. That she would spurn me for leaving her alone in the woods. That she would be silent and sullenly hurt. I worried that she might cry, or curse me, or simply turn and leave.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Denna gave me a delighted smile. “Kvothe!” She caught up my hand and pressed it between her own. “I’ve missed you. Where have you been?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I felt myself go weak with relief. “Oh, you know. Here and there.” I made a nonchalant gesture. “Around.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You left me dry in the dock the other day,” she said with a mock-serious glare. “I waited, but the tide never came.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I was about to explain things to her when Denna gestured to a man standing beside her. “Forgive my rudeness. Kvothe, this is Lentaren.” I hadn’t even noticed him. “Lentaren, Kvothe.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lentaren was tall and lean. Well muscled, well dressed, and well-bred. He had a jawline a mason would have been proud of and straight, white teeth. He looked like Prince Gallant out of a storybook. He reeked of money.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He smiled at me, his manner easy, friendly. “Nice to meet you, Kvothe,” he said with a graceful half-bow.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I returned the bow on pure reflex, smiling my most charming smile. “At your service, Lentaren.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I turned back to Denna. “We should have lunch one of these days,” I said blithely, arching one eyebrow ever so slightly, asking,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> is this Master Ash?</span></span><span class="calibre6"> “I have some interesting stories for you.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Absolutely,” she shook her head slightly, telling me,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> No.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> “You left before you could finish your last one. I was terribly disappointed that I missed the end. Distraught, in fact.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Oh it’s just the same thing you’ve heard before a hundred times before,” I said. “Prince Gallant kills the dragon but loses the treasure and the girl.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ah, a tragedy,” Denna looked down. “Not the ending I’d hoped for, but no more than I expected, I suppose.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It would be something of a tragedy if it stopped there,” I admitted. “But it depends on how you look at it, really. I prefer to think of it as a story that’s waiting for an appropriately uplifting sequel.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">A carriage trundled by on the road and Lentaren stepped out of the way, incidentally brushing up against Denna as he moved. She took hold of his arm absentmindedly. “I don’t generally go in for serial stories,” she said, her expression momentarily serious and unreadable. Then she shrugged and gave me a hint of a wry smile. “But I’ve certainly changed my mind about these things before. Maybe you’ll convince me otherwise.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I gestured to the lute case I carried slung over my shoulder. “I still play at Anker’s most nights if you’d like to stop in…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I will.” Denna sighed and looked up at Lentaren. “We’re already late, aren’t we?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He squinted up at the sun and nodded. “We are. But we can still catch them if we hurry.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">She turned back to me. “I’m sorry, we have a riding appointment.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I would never dream of keeping you,” I said, graciously stepping to one side, out of their way.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Lentaren and I nodded politely to each other. “I’ll come find you before too long,” she said, turning to face me as they walked past.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Go on.” I nodded in the direction they’d been heading. “Don’t let me keep you.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">They turned to go. I watched them walk through the cobbled streets of Imre. Together.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Wil and Sim were waiting for me by the time I arrived. They had already claimed a bench with a good view of the fountain in front of the Eolian. Water flared up around statuary nymphs being chased by a satyr.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I laid my lute case down beside the bench and absentmindedly flipped open the lid, thinking my lute might enjoy the feel of a little sun on its strings. If you aren’t a musician, I don’t expect you to understand.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Wil handed me an apple as I took a seat next to them. The wind brushed though the square and I watched the spray from the fountain move like gauzy curtains in the wind. A few red maple leaves danced circles on the cobblestones. I watched them as they skipped and twirled, tracing strange, complicated patterns in the empty air.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I’m guessing you finally found Denna?” Wilem asked after a while.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded without looking away from the leaves. I didn’t really feel like explaining.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I can tell because you’re quiet,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Didn’t go well?” Sim asked gently.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Didn’t turn out the way I’d hoped,” I said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">They nodded sagely and there was another moment of silence.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I was thinking about what you told us,” Wil said. “What your Denna said. There is a hole in her story.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Sim and I looked at him, curious.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“She said she was looking for her patron,” Wilem pointed out. “She was traveling with you to look for him. But later she said she knew he was safe because he-” Wil hesitated significantly, “-met with her as she was heading back to the burning farm. It does not fit. Why would she hunt for him if she knew he was safe?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I hadn’t considered that. Before I could think of a response, Simmon shook his head. “She was just making an excuse to spend time with him,” he said as if it were plain as day.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Wilem frowned a little.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Sim looked back and forth between us, plainly surprised he had to explain himself. “It’s obvious she has a thing for you,” he said, and began counting on his fingers. “She finds you at Anker’s. She comes to get you that night at Eolian when we’re drinking. She makes up an excuse to wander around the middle of nowhere with you for a couple of days…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Sim,” I said, exasperated. “If she was interested I’d be able to find her more than once in a month of searching.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That’s a logical fallacy,” Sim pointed out eagerly. “False cause. All that proves is that you’re lousy at finding her, or that she’s hard to find. Not that she’s not interested.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“In fact,” Wilem pointed out, taking up Simmon’s side, “since she finds you more often, it seems likely that she must spend a fair amount of time looking for you. You are not easy to track down. That indicates interest.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I thought about the note she had left me, and for a moment I entertained the thought that Sim might be right. I felt a faint hope flicker in my chest, remembering that night we lay atop the greystone.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then I remembered that Denna had been delirious out of her mind that night. And I remembered Denna on Lentaren’s arm. I thought of tall, handsome, wealthy Lentaren and all the other countless men who had something worthwhile to offer her. Something more than a good singing voice and manly bravado.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You know I’m right!” Simmon pushed his hair out of his eyes, laughing boyishly. “You can’t argue your way out of this one! She’s obviously stupid for you. And you’re just plain stupid, so it’s a great match.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I sighed. “Sim, I’m happy to have her as a friend. She’s a delightful person and I’m glad to spend time with her. That’s all there is.” I forced the proper amount of jovial unconcern into my voice so Sim would take me at my word and drop the subject for the time being.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Sim looked at me for a moment, then shrugged it off. “If that’s the case,” he said, gesturing with his piece of chicken, “Fela talks about you all the time. Thinks you’re a hell of a guy. Plus the whole saving her life thing. I’m pretty sure you have a chance there.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I shrugged, watching the patterns the wind made in the fountain’s spray.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You know what we should…” Sim stopped midthought, staring past me, his expression going suddenly blank.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I turned to see what he was looking at and saw my lute case, empty. My lute was gone. I looked around wildly, ready to spring to my feet and dash off searching for it. But there was no need-a few feet away stood Ambrose and a few of his friends. He held my lute loosely in one hand.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Oh, merciful Tehlu,” Simmon muttered behind me. Then at a normal volume he said, “Give it back, Ambrose.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Quiet, E’lir,” Ambrose snapped. “This is none of your concern.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I got to my feet, keeping my eyes on him, on my lute. I had come to think of Ambrose as taller than me, but when I stood I saw that we were eye level with each other. Ambrose seemed a bit surprised as well.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Give it to me,” I said, and stretched out my hand. I was surprised to see that it wasn’t shaking. I was shaking inside: half fear, half fury.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Two parts of me tried to speak at the same time. The first part cried,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Please don’t do anything to it. Not again. Don’t break it. Please give it back. Don’t hold it by the neck like that.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> The other half of me was chanting,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you,</span></span><span class="calibre6"> like spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I took a step forward. “Give it to me.” My voice sounded odd to my own ears, emotionless and flat. Flat as my outstretched palm. I had stopped shaking inside.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He paused for a moment, caught unaware by something in my tone. I could sense his unease-I wasn’t acting the way he had expected. Behind me, I could hear Wilem and Simmon hold their breath. Behind Ambrose, his friends paused, suddenly unsure.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose smiled and cocked an eyebrow. “But I’ve written a song for you, and it needs to be accompanied.” He gripped the lute roughly and dragged his fingers across the strings with no thought for rhythm or tune. People stopped to watch as he sang:</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“There once was a ravel named Kvothe</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Whose tongue was quick at quipping.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">The masters thought him clever</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">And rewarded him with whipping.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Quite a few passersby had stopped to watch by this point, smiling and laughing at Ambrose’s little show. Encouraged, Ambrose made a sweeping bow.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Everyone sing!” he shouted, raising his hands like an orchestra conductor, gesturing with my lute like a baton.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I took another step forward. “Give it back, or I will kill you.” At that moment, I meant it in perfect earnest.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Everything grew quiet again. Seeing he wasn’t going to get the rise he had expected from me, Ambrose affected nonchalance. “Some people have no sense of humor,” he said with a sigh. “Catch.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He tossed it to me, but lutes are not meant to be tossed. It twisted awkwardly in the air, and when I grabbed, there was nothing in my hands. Whether he was clumsy or cruel makes not the slightest difference to me. My lute hit the cobblestones bowl first and made a splintering noise.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The sound reminded me of the terrible noise my father’s lute had made, crushed beneath my body in a soot-streaked alley in Tarbean. I bent to pick it up and it made a noise like a wounded animal. Ambrose half-turned to look back at me and I saw flickers of amusement play across his face.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I opened my mouth to howl, to cry, to curse him. But something</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> other</span></span><span class="calibre6"> tore from my throat, a word I did not know and could not remember.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then all I could hear was the sound of the wind. It roared into the courtyard like a sudden storm. A nearby carriage slid sideways across the cobblestones, its horses rearing up in panic. Sheet music was torn from someone’s hands to streak around us like strange lightning. I was pushed forward a step. Everyone was pushed by the wind. Everyone but Ambrose, who pinwheeled to the ground as if struck by the hand of God.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then everything was still again. Papers fell, twisting like autumn leaves. People looked around, dazed, their hair tousled and clothes in disarray. Several people staggered as they braced against a storm that was no longer there.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My throat hurt. My lute was broken.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Ambrose staggered to his feet. He held his arm awkwardly at his side and blood was running down from his scalp. The look of wild, confused fear he gave me was a brief, sweet pleasure. I considered shouting at him again, wondering what would happen. Would the wind come again? Would the ground swallow him up?</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I heard a horse whinnying in panic. People began to pour from the Eolian and the other buildings around the courtyard. Musicians looked around wildly, and everyone was talking at once.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…was that?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…notes are all over. Help me before they get…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…did it. Him over there, with the red…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“…demon. A demon of wind and…”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I looked around in mute confusion until Wilem and Simmon hurried me away.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“We didn’t know where to take him,” Simmon said to Kilvin.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Say it all to me again,” Kilvin said calmly. “But this time only one talks.” He pointed at Wilem. “Try to put the words all in a tidy row.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">We were in Kilvin’s office. The door was closed and the curtains drawn. Wilem began to explain what had happened. As he gained speed he switched to Siaru. Kilvin kept nodding along, his face thoughtful. Simmon listened intently, occasionally interjecting a word or two.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I sat on a stool nearby. My mind was a whirl of confusion and half-formed questions. My throat was sore. My body was weary and full of sour adrenaline. In the middle of it all, deep in the center of my chest, a piece of me burned in anger like a forge coal fanned red and hot. All around me there was a great numbness, as if I were sealed in wax ten inches thick. There was no Kvothe, only the confusion, the anger, and the numbness wrapping them. I was like a sparrow in a storm, unable to find a safe branch to cling to. Unable to control the tumbling motion of my flight.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Wilem was reaching the end of his explanation when Elodin entered the room without knocking or announcing himself. Wilem fell silent. I spared the Master Namer half a glance then looked back toward the shattered lute in my hands. As I turned it over in my hands, one of its sharp edges cut my finger. I blankly watched the blood well up and fall to the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin came to stand directly in front of me, not bothering to speak to anyone else. “Kvothe?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He’s not right, Master,” Simmon said, his voice shrill with worry. “He’s gone all dumb. He won’t say a thing.” While I heard the words, knew they had meaning, even knew the meanings that belonged to them, I couldn’t pull any sense from them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I think he struck his head,” Wilem said. “He looks at you, but nothing is there. His eyes are like a dog’s eyes.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Kvothe?” Elodin repeated. When I didn’t respond or look up from my lute he reached forward and gently tipped my chin up until I met his eye. “Kvothe.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I blinked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He looked at me. His dark eyes steadied me somewhat. Slowed the storm inside me.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> “Aerlevsedi,”</span></span><span class="calibre6"> he said. “Say it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What?” Simmon said somewhere in the distant background. “Wind?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“Aerlevsedi,”</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Elodin repeated patiently, his dark eyes intent upon my face.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">“Aerlevsedi,”</span></span><span class="calibre6"> I said numbly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin closed his eyes briefly, peacefully. As if he were trying to catch a faint strain of music wafting gently on a breeze. Unable to see his eyes, I began to drift. I looked back down toward the broken lute in my hands, but before my gaze wandered too far he caught my chin again, tilting my face up.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">His eyes caught mine. The numbness faded, but the storm still turned inside my head. Then Elodin’s eyes changed. He stopped looking toward me and looked</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> into</span></span><span class="calibre6"> me. That is the only way I can describe it. He looked deep into me, not into my eyes, but through my eyes. His gaze went into me and settled solidly in my chest, as if he had both his hands inside me, feeling the shape of my lungs, the movement of my heart, the heat of my anger, the pattern of the storm that thundered inside me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He leaned forward and his lips brushed my ear. I felt his breath. He spoke…and the storm stilled. I found a place to land.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There is a game all children try at some time or another. You fling out your arms and spin round and round, watching as the world blurs. First you are disoriented, but if you continue to spin long enough the world resolves itself, and you are no longer dizzy as you spin with the world blurring around you.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then you stop and the world lurches into regular shape. The dizziness strikes you like a thunderclap, everything lurches, moves. The world tilts around you.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">That is what happened when Elodin stilled the storm in my head. Suddenly, violently dizzy I cried out and raised my hands to keep myself from falling sideways, falling upward, falling inward. I felt arms catch me as my feet tangled in the stool and I began to topple to the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was terrifying, but it faded. By the time I recovered, Elodin was gone.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_88"></div></div>
