I found a patch of wild strawberries. I dug for roots. By the end of the fourth day, I had everything I needed to survive: a stone-lined fire pit, a shelter for my lute. I had even assembled a small stockpile of foodstuffs that I could fall back on in case of emergency.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I also had one thing I did not need: time. After I had taken care of immediate needs, I found I had nothing to do. I think this is when a small part of my mind started to slowly reawaken itself.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Make no mistake, I was not myself. At least I was not the same person I had been a span of days before. Everything I did I attended to with my whole mind, leaving no part of me free for remembering.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I grew thinner and more ragged. I slept in rain or sun, on soft grass, moist earth, or sharp stones with an intensity of indifference that only grief can promote. The only notice I took of my surroundings was when it rained, because then I could not bring out my lute to play, and that pained me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Of course I played. It was my only solace.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">By the end of the first month, my fingers had calluses hard as stones and I could play for hours upon hours. I played and played again all of the songs I knew from memory. Then I played the half-remembered songs as well, filling in the forgotten parts as best I could.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Eventually I could play from when I woke until the time I slept. I stopped playing the songs I knew and started inventing new ones. I had made up songs before; I had even helped my father compose a verse or two. But now I gave it my whole attention. Some of those songs have stayed with me to this day.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Soon after that I began playing…how can I describe it?</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I began to play something other than songs. When the sun warms the grass and the breeze cools you, it feels a certain way. I would play until I got the feeling right. I would play until it sounded like Warm Grass and Cool Breeze.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I was only playing for myself, but I was a harsh audience. I remember spending nearly three whole days trying to capture Wind Turning a Leaf.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">By the end of the second month, I could play things nearly as easily as I saw and felt them: Sun Setting Behind the Clouds, Bird Taking a Drink, Dew in the Bracken.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Somewhere in the third month I stopped looking outside and started looking inside for things to play. I learned to play Riding in the Wagon with Ben, Singing with Father by the Fire, Watching Shandi Dance, Grinding Leaves When it Is Nice Outside, Mother Smiling…</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Needless to say, playing these things hurt, but it was a hurt like tender fingers on lute strings. I bled a bit and hoped that I would callous soon.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Toward the end of summer, one of the strings broke, broke beyond repair. I spent the better part of the day in a mute stupor, unsure of what to do. My mind was still numb and mostly asleep. I focused with a dim shadow of my usual cleverness on my problem. After realizing that I could neither make a string nor acquire a new one, I sat back down and began to learn to play with only six strings.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">In a span I was nearly as good with six strings as I had been with seven. Three span later I was trying to play Waiting While it Rains when a second string broke.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">This time I didn’t hesitate, I stripped off the useless string and started to learn again.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was midway through Reaping when the third string broke. After trying for nearly half a day, I realized that three broken strings were too many. So I packed a small dull knife, half a ball of string, and Ben’s book into a tattered canvas sack. Then I shouldered my father’s lute and began to walk.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I tried humming Snow Falling with the Late Autumn Leaves; Calloused Fingers and a Lute With Four Strings, but it wasn’t the same as playing it.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My plan was to find a road and follow it to a town. I had no idea how far I was from either, in which direction they might lie, or what their names might be. I knew I was somewhere in the southern Commonwealth, but the precise location was buried, tangled up with other memories that I was not eager to unearth.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The weather helped me make up my mind. Cool autumn was turning to winter’s chill. I knew the weather was warmer to the south. So, lacking any better plan, I set the sun on my left shoulder and tried to cover as much distance as I could.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The next span was an ordeal. The little food I’d brought with me was soon gone, and I had to stop and forage when I was hungry. Some days I couldn’t find water, and when I did I had nothing I could use to carry it. The small wagon track joined a bigger road, which joined a larger road yet. My feet chafed and blistered against the insides of my shoes. Some nights were bitter cold.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There were inns, but aside from the occasional drink I stole from horse troughs, I gave them a wide berth. There were a few small towns as well, but I needed someplace larger. Farmers have no need for lute strings.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">At first, whenever I heard a wagon or a horse approaching I found myself limping off to hide by the side of the road. I had not spoken with another human since the night my family was killed. I was more akin to a wild animal than a boy of twelve. But eventually the road became too large and well traveled, and I found myself spending more time hiding than walking. I finally braved the traffic and was relieved when I was largely ignored.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I had been walking for less than an hour one morning when I heard a wagon coming up behind me. The road was wide enough for two wagons to run abreast, but I moved to the grass at the edge of the road anyway.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Hey, boy!” a rough male voice behind me yelled. I didn’t turn around. “Hullo, boy!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I moved farther off the road into the grass without looking behind me. I kept my eyes on the ground beneath my feet.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The wagon pulled slowly alongside me. The voice bellowed twice as loud as before, “Boy. Boy!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I looked up and saw a weathered old man squinting against the sun. He could have been anywhere from forty to seventy years old. There was a thick-shouldered, plain-faced young man sitting next to him on the wagon. I guessed they were father and son.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Are ye deaf, boy?” The old man pronounced it</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> deef.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I shook my head.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ye dumb then?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I shook my head again. “No.” It felt strange talking to someone. My voice sounded odd, rough and rusty from disuse.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He squinted at me. “You goin’ into the city?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded, not wanting to talk again.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Get in then.” He nodded toward the back of the wagon. “Sam won’t mind pulling a little whippet like yuself.” He patted the rump of his mule.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was easier to agree than run away. And the blisters on my feet were stinging from the sweat in my shoes. I moved to the back of the open cart and climbed on, pulling my lute after me. The back of the open wagon was about three-quarters full of large burlap bags. A few round, knobby squash had spilled from an open sack and were rolling aimlessly around on the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The old man shook the reins. “Hup!” and the mule grudgingly picked up its pace. I picked up the few loose squash and tucked them into the bag that had fallen open. The old farmer gave me a smile over his shoulder. “Thanks, boy. I’m Seth, and this here is Jake. You might want to be sittin’ down, a bad bump could tip ye over the side.” I sat on one of the bags, tense for no good reason, not knowing what to expect.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The old farmer handed the reins to his son and brought a large brown loaf of bread out of a sack that sat between the two of them. He casually tore off a large chunk, spread a thick dab of butter onto it, and handed it back to me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">This casual kindness made my chest ache. It had been half a year since I had eaten bread. It was soft and warm and the butter was sweet. I saved a piece for later, tucking it into my canvas sack.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">After a quiet quarter of an hour, the old man turned halfway around. “Do you play that thing, boy?” He gestured to the lute case.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I clutched it closer to my body. “It’s broken.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ah,” he said, disappointed. I thought he was going to ask me to get off, but instead he smiled and nodded to the man beside him. “We’ll just have to be entertainin’ you instead.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He started to sing “Tinker Tanner,” a drinking song that is older than God. After a second his son joined in, and their rough voices made a simple harmony that set something inside me aching as I remembered other wagons, different songs, a half-forgotten home.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_23"></div></div>
