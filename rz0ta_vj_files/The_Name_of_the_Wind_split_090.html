For a second I was afraid that I was going to be violently ill right there in front of everyone.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Does any master oppose this action?” the Chancellor asked ritualistically as I looked down at my feet.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I do,” the stirring voice could only be Elodin’s.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“All in favor of suspending expulsion?” I looked up again in time to see Elodin’s hand. Elxa Dal’s. Kilvin, Lorren, the Chancellor. All hands save Hemme’s. I almost laughed out of shock and sheer disbelief. Elodin gave me his boyish smile again.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Expulsion repealed,” the Chancellor said firmly and I felt Ambrose’s satisfaction flicker and wane beside me. “Are there any further issues?” I caught an odd note in the Chancellor’s voice. He was expecting something.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was Elodin who spoke. “I move that Kvothe be raised to the rank of Re’lar.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“All in favor?” All hands save Hemme’s were raised in a single motion. “Kvothe is raised to Re’lar with Elodin as sponsor on the fifth of Fallow. Meeting adjourned.” He pushed himself up from the table and made his way to the door.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What?!” Ambrose yelled, looking around as if he couldn’t decide who he was asking. Finally he scampered off after Hemme, who was making a quick exit behind the Chancellor and the majority of the other masters. I noticed he wasn’t limping nearly as much as he had before the trial began.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Bewildered, I stood stupidly until Elodin came over and shook my unresponsive hand. “Confused?” he asked. “Come walk with me. I’ll explain.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The bright afternoon sunlight was a shock after the shadowy cool of Hollows. Elodin awkwardly pulled his master’s robes up over his head. Underneath he was wearing a simple white shirt and a pair of rather disreputable looking pants held up by a piece of frayed rope. I saw for the first time that he was barefoot. The tops of his feet showed the same healthy tan as his arms and face.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Do you know what</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Re’lar</span></span><span class="calibre6"> means?” he asked me conversationally.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It translates as ‘speaker,’” I said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Do you know what it</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> means</span></span><span class="calibre6">?” he stressed the word.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Not really,” I admitted.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin drew a deep breath. “Once upon a time, there was a University. It was built in the dead ruins of an older University. It wasn’t very big, perhaps fifty people in all. But it was the best University for miles and miles, so people came and learned and left. There was a small group of people who gathered there. People whose knowledge went beyond mathematics and grammar and rhetoric.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“They started a smaller group inside the University. They called it the Arcanum and it was a very small, very secret thing. They had a ranking system among themselves, and your rise through those ranks was due to prowess and nothing else. One entered this group by proving they could see things for what they really were. They became E’lir, which means see-er. How do you think they became Re’lar?” He looked at me expectantly.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“By speaking.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He laughed. “Right!” He stopped and turned to face me. “But speaking what?” His eyes were bright and sharp.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Words?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Names,” he said excitedly. “Names are the shape of the world, and a man who can speak them is on the road to power. Back in the beginning, the Arcanum was a small collection of men who understood things. Men who knew powerful names. They taught a few students, slowly, carefully encouraging them toward power and wisdom. And magic. Real magic.” He looked around at the buildings and milling students. “In those days the Arcanum was a strong brandy. Now it is well-watered wine.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I waited until I was sure he was finished. “Master Elodin, what happened yesterday?” I held my breath and hoped beyond hope for an intelligible answer.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He gave me a quizzical look. “You called the name of the wind,” he said as if the answer were obvious.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“But what does that mean? And what do you mean by</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> name?</span></span><span class="calibre6"> Is it just a name like ‘Kvothe’ or ‘Elodin’? Or is it more like ‘Taborlin knew the names of many things.’”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Like both,” he said, waving to a pretty girl leaning out a second-story window.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“But how can a name do something like that? ‘Kvothe’ and ‘Elodin’ are just sounds we make, they don’t have any power by themselves.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin raised his eyebrows at this. “Really? Watch.” He looked down the street. “Nathan!” he shouted. A boy turned to look in our direction. I recognized him as one of Jamison’s errand boys. “Nathan, come here!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The boy trotted over and looked up at Elodin. “Yes sir?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin handed the boy his master’s robe. “Nathan, would you take this to my rooms for me?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Certainly sir,” the boy took the robe and hurried away.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin looked at me. “Do you see? The names we call each other are not</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Names</span></span><span class="calibre6">. But they have some power nonetheless.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“That’s not magic,” I protested. “He had to listen to you. You’re a master.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And you’re a Re’lar,” he said implacably. “You called the wind and the wind listened.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I struggled with the concept. “You’re saying the wind is alive?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He made a vague gesture. “In a way. Most things are alive in one way or another.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I decided to take a different tack. “How did I call the wind if I didn’t know how?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin clapped his hands together, sharply. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">That</span></span><span class="calibre6"> is an excellent question! The answer is that each of us has two minds: a waking mind and a sleeping mind. Our waking mind is what thinks and talks and reasons. But the sleeping mind is more powerful. It sees deeply to the heart of things. It is the part of us that dreams. It remembers everything. It gives us intuition. Your waking mind does not understand the nature of names. Your sleeping mind does. It already knows many things that your waking mind does not.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin looked at me. “Remember how you felt after you called the name of the wind?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I nodded, not enjoying the memory.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“When Ambrose broke your lute, it roused your sleeping mind. Like a great hibernating bear jabbed with a burning stick, it reared up and roared the name of the wind.” He swung his arms around wildly, attracting odd looks from passing students. “Afterward your waking mind did not know what to do. It was left with an angry bear.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What did you do? I can’t remember what you whispered to me.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It was a name. It was a name that settled the angry bear, eased it back to sleep. But it is not sleeping so soundly now. We need to rouse it slowly and bring it under your control.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Is that why you moved to suspend my expulsion?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He made a dismissive gesture. “You were in no real danger of being expelled. You are not the first student to call the name of the wind in anger, though you are the first in several years. Some strong emotion usually wakes the sleeping mind for the first time.” He smiled. “The name of the wind came to me when I was arguing with Elxa Dal. When I shouted it his braziers exploded in a cloud of burning ash and cinder,” he chuckled.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What did he do to make you so angry?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“He refused to teach me the advanced bindings. I was only fourteen and an E’lir. He told me I would have to wait until I was a Re’lar.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“There are advanced bindings?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He grinned at me. “Secrets, Re’lar Kvothe. That is what being an arcanist is all about. Now that you are a Re’lar you are entitled to certain things that were withheld before. The advanced sympathetic bindings, the nature of names. Some smattering of dubious runes, if Kilvin thinks you’re ready.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Hope rose in my chest. “Does this mean I’m allowed access to the Archives now?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ah,” Elodin said. “No. Not in the least. You see, the Archives are Lorren’s domain, his kingdom. Those secrets are not mine to give away.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">At his mention of secrets my mind settled on one that had been bothering me for months. The secret at the heart of the Archives. “What about the stone door in the Archives?” I asked. “The four-plate door. Now that I’m a Re’lar can you tell me what’s behind it?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin laughed. “Oh no. No no. You don’t aim for small secrets do you?” He clapped me on the back as if I’d just made an especially good joke. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Valaritas.</span></span><span class="calibre6"> God. I can still remember what it was like, standing down there looking at the door, wondering.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He laughed again. “Merciful Tehlu, it almost killed me.” He shook his head. “No. You don’t get to go behind the four-plate door. But,” he gave me a conspiratorial look. “Since you are a Re’lar…” He looked from side to side as if afraid that someone might overhear us. I leaned closer. “Since you are a Re’lar, I will admit that it exists.” He gave me a solemn wink.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Disappointed as I was, I couldn’t help but smile. We walked for a while in silence past Mains, past Anker’s. “Master Elodin?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Yes?” His eyes followed a squirrel across the road and up a tree.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I still don’t understand about names.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I will teach you to understand,” he said easily. “The nature of names cannot be described, only experienced and understood.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Why can’t it be described?” I asked. “If you understand a thing, you can describe it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Can you describe all the things you understand?” he looked sideways at me.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Of course.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Elodin pointed down the street. “What color is that boy’s shirt?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Blue.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What do you mean by blue? Describe it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I struggled for a moment, failed. “So</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> blue</span></span><span class="calibre6"> is a name?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“It is a word. Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts. There are seven words that will make a person love you. There are ten words that will break a strong man’s will. But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire. A name is the fire itself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">My head was swimming by this point. “I still don’t understand.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He laid a hand on my shoulder. “Using words to talk of words is like using a pencil to draw a picture of itself, on itself. Impossible. Confusing. Frustrating.” He lifted his hands high above his head as if stretching for the sky. “But there are other ways to understanding!” he shouted, laughing like a child. He threw both arms to the cloudless arch of sky above us, still laughing. “Look!” he shouted tilting his head back. “Blue! Blue! Blue!”</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_90"></div></div>
