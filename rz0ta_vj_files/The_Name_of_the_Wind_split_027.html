Since I still had food and a little wine I stayed where I was rather than risk falling when I tried to climb down to the street.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was a sunless day with a damp wind that never seemed to stop. Sleet gusted under the protection of the overhanging roof. The chimney was warm behind me, but it wasn’t enough to actually dry out my blanket or drive away the chilly damp that soaked my clothes.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I finished the wine and the bread early on, and after that I spent most of my time gnawing at the turkey bones and trying to warm up snow in the empty wine flask so I could drink it. Neither proved very productive, and I ended up eating mouthfuls of slushy snow that left me shivering with the taste of tar in my mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Despite my injuries I dropped off to sleep in the afternoon and woke late at night filled with the most wonderful warmth. I pushed away my blanket and rolled away from the now too-hot chimney only to wake near dawn, shivering and soaked through to the skin. I felt strange, dizzy and fuddled. I huddled back against the chimney and spent the rest of the day drifting in and out of a restless, fevered sleep.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I have no memory of how I made it off the rooftop, delirious with fever and nearly crippled. I don’t remember making my way the three-quarters of a mile through Tallows and the Crates. I only remember falling down the stairs that led to Trapis’ basement, my purse of money clutched tight in my hand. As I lay there shivering and sweating I heard the faint slapping of his bare feet on the stone.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What what,” he said gently as he picked me up. “Hush hush.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Trapis nursed me through the long days of my fever. He wrapped me in blankets, fed me, and when my fever showed no signs of breaking on its own, he used the money I’d brought to buy a bittersweet medicine. He kept my face and hands wet and cool while murmuring his patient, gentle, “What what. Hush hush,” while I cried out from endless fever dreams of my dead parents, the Chandrian, and a man with empty eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I woke clear-headed and cool.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Oooohreeee,” Tanee said loudly from where he was tied to his cot.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What what. Hush hush, Tanee.” Trapis said as he put down one of the babies and picked up the other. It looked around owlishly with wide, dark eyes, but seemed unable to support its own head. It was quiet in the room.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ooooooohreeee,” Tanee said again.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I coughed, trying to clear my throat.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“There’s a cup on the floor next to you,” Trapis said, brushing a hand along the head of the baby he held.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“OOOOOH OOHRRRREE EEEEEEHHAA!” Tanee bellowed, strange half-gasps punctuating his cry. The noise agitated several of the others who moved restlessly in their cots. The older boy sitting in the corner raised his hands to the sides of his head and began to moan. He started rocking back and forth, gently at first, but then more and more violently so that when he came forward his head knocked against the bare stone of the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Trapis was at his side before the boy could do himself any real harm. He put his arms around the rocking boy. “Hush hush, Loni. Hush hush.” The boy’s rocking slowed but did not entirely subside. “Tanee, you know better than to make all that noise.” His voice was serious, but not stern. “Why are you making trouble? Loni could hurt himself.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Oorrahee,” Tanee said softly. I thought I could detect a note of remorse in his voice.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I think he wants a story,” I said, surprising myself by speaking.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Aaaa,” Tanee said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Is that what you want, Tanee?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Aaaa.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was a quiet moment. “I don’t know any stories,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tanee remained stubbornly silent.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6">Everyone knows one story,</span></span><span class="calibre6"> I thought.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Everyone knows at least one.</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Ooooooree!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Trapis looked around at the quiet room, as if looking for an excuse. “Well,” he said reluctantly. “It has been a while since we had a story, hasn’t it?” He looked down at the boy in his arms. “Would you like a story, Loni?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Loni nodded a violent affirmation, nearly battering Trapis’ cheek with the back of his head.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Will you be good and sit by yourself, so I can tell a story?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Loni stopped rocking almost immediately. Trapis slowly unwrapped his arms and stepped away. After a long look to make sure the boy wouldn’t hurt himself, he stepped carefully back to his chair.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Well,” he muttered softly to himself as he stooped to pick up the baby he had set aside. “Do I have a story?” He spoke very quietly to the child’s wide eyes. “No. No, I don’t. Can I remember one? I suppose I had better.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He sat for a long moment, humming to the child in his arms, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Yes, of course.” He sat up taller in his chair. “Are you ready?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">This is a story from long ago. Back before any of us were born. Before our fathers were born, too. It was a long time ago. Maybe-maybe four hundred years. No, more than that. Probably a thousand years. But maybe not quite as much as that.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">It was a bad time in the world. People were hungry and sick. There were famines and great plagues. There were many wars and other bad things in this time, because there was no one to stop them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But the worst thing in this time was that there were demons walking the land. Some of them were small and troublesome, creatures who lamed horses and spoiled milk. But there were many worse than those.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There were demons who hid in men’s bodies and made them sick or mad, but those were not the worst. There were demons like great beasts that would catch and eat men while they were still alive and screaming, but they were not the worst. Some demons stole the skins of men and wore them like clothes, but even they were not the worst.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">There was one demon that stood above the others. Encanis, the swallowing darkness. No matter where he walked, shadows hid his face, and scorpions that stung him died of the corruption they had touched.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Now Tehlu, who made the world and who is lord over all, watched the world of men. He saw that demons made sport of us and killed us and ate our bodies. Some men he saved, but only a few. For Tehlu is just and saves only the worthy, and in these times few men acted even for their own good, let alone the good of others.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Because of this, Tehlu was unhappy. For he had made the world to be a good place for men to live. But his church was corrupt. They stole from the poor and did not live by the laws he had given…</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">No, wait. There was no church yet, and no priests either. Just men and women, and some of them knew who Tehlu was. But even those were wicked, so when they called on Lord Tehlu for help he felt no desire to aid them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But after years of watching and waiting, Tehlu saw a woman pure of heart and spirit. Her name was Perial. Her mother had raised her to know Tehlu, and she worshiped him as well as her poor circumstances allowed. Although her own life was hard, Perial prayed only for others, and never for herself.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu watched her for long years. He saw her life was hard, full of misfortune and torment at the hands of demons and bad men. But she never cursed his name or ceased her praying, and she never treated any person other than with kindness and respect.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So late one night, Tehlu went to her in a dream. He stood before her, and seemed to be made entirely of fire or sunlight. He came to her in splendor and asked her if she knew who he was.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Sure enough,” she said. You see, she was very calm about it because she thought she was just having an odd dream. “You’re Lord Tehlu.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He nodded and asked her if she knew why he had come to her.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Are you going to do something for my neighbor Deborah?” she asked. Because that’s who she had prayed for before she went to sleep. “Are you going to lay your hand on her husband Losel and make him a better man? The way he treats her isn’t right. Man should never lay a hand on woman, save in love.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu knew her neighbors. He knew they were wicked people who had done wicked things. Everyone in the village was wicked but her. Everyone in the world was. He told her so.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Deborah has been very kind and good to me,” Perial said. “And even Losel, who I don’t care for, is one of my neighbors all the same.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu told her that Deborah spent time in many different men’s beds, and Losel drank every day of the week, even on Mourning. No, wait-there wasn’t any Mourning yet. But he drank a lot at any rate. Sometimes he grew so angry that he beat his wife until she could not stand or even cry aloud.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Perial was quiet for a long moment in her dream. She knew Tehlu spoke the truth, but while Perial was pure of heart, she was not a fool. She had suspected her neighbors of doing the things Tehlu said. Even now that she knew for certain, she cared for her neighbors all the same. “You won’t help her?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu said that the man and wife were each other’s fitting punishment. They were wicked and the wicked should be punished.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Perial spoke out honestly, perhaps because she thought she was dreaming, but perhaps she would have said the same thing had she been awake, for Perial said what was in her heart. “It’s not their fault that the world is full of hard choices and hunger and loneliness,” she said. “What can you expect of people when demons are their neighbors?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But though Tehlu listened to her wise words with his ears, he told her that mankind was wicked, and the wicked should be punished.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I think you know very little about what it is to be a man,” she said. “And I would still help them if I could,” she told him resolutely.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">SO YOU SHALL, Tehlu told her, and reached out to lay his hand on her heart. When he touched her she felt like she were a great golden bell that had just rung out its first note. She opened her eyes and knew then that it had been no normal dream.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Thus it was that she was not surprised to discover she was pregnant. In three months she gave birth to a perfect dark-eyed baby boy. She named him Menda. The day after he was born, Menda could crawl. In two days he could walk. Perial was surprised, but not worried, for she knew the child was a gift from God.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Nevertheless, Perial was wise. She knew that people might not understand. So she kept Menda close by her, and when her friends and neighbors came to visit, she sent them away.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But this could only last a little while, for in a small town there are no secrets. Folk knew that Perial was not married. And while children born out of wedlock were common during this time, children who grew to manhood in less than two months were not. They were afraid that she might have lain down with a demon, and that her child was a demon’s child. Such things were not unheard of in those dark times, and the people were afraid.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So everyone gathered together on the first day of the seventh span, and made their way to the tiny house where Perial lived by herself with her son. The town smith, whose name was Rengen, led them. “Show us the boy,” he yelled. But there was no response from the house. “Bring out the boy, and show us he is nothing but a human child.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The house remained quiet, and though there were many men among them, no one wanted to enter a house that might have a demon’s child inside. So the smith cried out again, “Perial, bring out young Menda, or we will burn your house around you.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The door opened, and a man stepped out. None of them recognized who it was, because even though he was only seven span from the womb, Menda looked to be a young man of seventeen. He stood proud and tall, with coal-black hair and eyes. “I am the one you think is Menda,” he said in a voice both powerful and deep. “What do you want of me?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The sound of his voice made Perial gasp inside the cottage. Not only was this the first time Menda had ever spoken, but she recognized his voice as the same one that had spoken to her in a dream, months ago.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What do you mean, we think you are Menda?” asked the smith, gripping his hammer tightly. He knew that there were demons that looked like men, or wore their skins like costumes, the way a man might hide beneath a sheepskin.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The child who was not a child spoke again. “I am Perial’s son, but I am not Menda. And I am not a demon.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Touch the iron of my hammer then,” said Rengen, for he knew all demons feared two things, cold iron and clean fire. He held out his heavy forge hammer. It shook in his hands, but no one thought the less of him for it.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">He who was not Menda stepped forward and lay both hands on the iron head of the hammer. Nothing happened. From the doorway of her house where she watched, Perial burst into tears, for though she trusted Tehlu, some part of her had held a mother’s worry for her son.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“I am not Menda, though that is what my mother called me. I am Tehlu, lord above all. I have come to free you from demons and the wickedness of your own hearts. I am Tehlu, son of myself. Let the wicked hear my voice and tremble.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">And they did tremble. But some of them refused to believe. They called him a demon and threatened him. They spoke hard, frightened words. Some threw stones and cursed him, and spat toward him and his mother.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then Tehlu grew angry, and he might have slain them all, but Perial leaped forward and laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. “What more can you expect?” she asked him quietly. “From men who live with demons for their neighbors? Even the best dog will bite that has been kicked enough.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu considered her words and saw that she was wise. So he looked over his hands at Rengen, looked deep into his heart and said, “Rengen, son of Engen, you have a mistress who you pay to lie with you. Some men come to you for work and you cheat or steal from them. And though you pray loudly, you do not believe I, Tehlu, made the world and watch over all who live here.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When Rengen heard this, he grew pale and dropped his hammer to the ground. For what Tehlu said to him was true. Tehlu looked at all the men and women there. He looked into their hearts and spoke of what he saw. All of them were wicked, so much that Rengen was among the best of them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then Tehlu drew a line in the dirt of the road so that it lay between himself and all those who had come. “This road is like the meandering course of a life. There are two paths to take, side by side. Each of you are already traveling that side. You must choose. Stay on your own path, or cross to mine.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“But the road is the same, isn’t it? It still goes to the same place,” someone asked.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Where does the road lead?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Death. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of things.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Then what does it matter which side a man is on?” It was Rengen asking these questions. He was a large man, one of the few that was taller than dark-eyed Tehlu. But he was shaken by all that he had seen and heard in the past few hours. “What is on our side of the road?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Pain,” Tehlu said in a voice as hard and cold as stone. “Punishment.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“And your side?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Pain now,” Tehlu said in the same voice. “Punishment now, for all that you have done. It cannot be avoided. But I am here too, this is my path.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“How do I cross?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Regret, repent, and cross to me.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Rengen stepped over the line to stand beside his God. Then Tehlu bent to pick up the hammer that the smith had dropped. But instead of giving it back, he struck Rengen with it as if it were a lash. Once. Twice. Thrice. And the third blow sent Rengen to his knees sobbing and crying out in pain. But after the third blow, Tehlu laid the hammer aside and knelt to look Rengen in the face. “You were the first to cross,” he said softly so only the smith could hear. “It was a brave thing, a hard thing to do. I am proud of you. You are no longer Rengen, now you are Wereth, the forger of the path.” Then Tehlu embraced him with both arms, and his touch took much of the pain from Rengen who was now Wereth. But not all, for Tehlu spoke truly when he said that punishment cannot be avoided.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">One by one they crossed, and one by one Tehlu struck them down with the hammer. But after each man or woman fell, Tehlu knelt and spoke to them, giving them new names and healing some of their hurt.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Many of the men and women had demons hiding inside them that fled screaming when the hammer touched them. These people Tehlu spoke with a while longer, but he always embraced them in the end, and they were all grateful. Some of them danced for the joy of being free of such terrible things living inside them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">In the end, seven stayed on the other side of the line. Tehlu asked them three times if they would cross, and three times they refused. After the third asking Tehlu sprang across the line and he struck each of them a great blow, driving them to the ground.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But not all were men. When Tehlu struck the fourth, there was the sound of quenching iron and the smell of burning leather. For the fourth man had not been a man at all, but a demon wearing a man’s skin. When it was revealed, Tehlu grabbed the demon and broke it in his hands, cursing its name and sending it back to the outer darkness that is the home of its kind.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The remaining three let themselves be struck down. None of them were demons, though demons fled the bodies of some who fell. After he was done, Tehlu did not speak to the six who did not cross, nor did he kneel to embrace them and ease their wounds.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The next day, Tehlu set off to finish what he had begun. He walked from town to town, offering each village he met the same choice he had given before. Always the results were the same, some crossed, some stayed, some were not men at all but demons, and those he destroyed.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">But there was one demon who eluded Tehlu. Encanis, whose face was all in shadow. Encanis, whose voice was like a knife in the minds of men.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer men the choice of path, Encanis had been there just before, killing crops and poisoning wells. Encanis, setting men to murder one another and stealing children from their beds at night.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">At the end of seven years, Tehlu’s feet had carried him all through the world. He had driven out the demons that plagued us. All but one. Encanis ran free and did the work of a thousand demons, destroying and despoiling wherever he went.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So Tehlu chased and Encanis fled. Soon Tehlu was a span of days behind the demon, then two days, then half a day. Finally he was so close he felt the chill of Encanis’ passing and could spy places where he had set his hands and feet, for they were marked with a cold, black frost.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Knowing he was pursued, Encanis came to a great city. The Lord of Demons called forth his power and the city was brought to ruin. He did this hoping Tehlu would delay so he could make his escape, but the Walking God paused only to appoint priests who cared for the people of the ruined town.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">For six days Encanis fled, and six great cities he destroyed. But on the seventh day, Tehlu drew near before Encanis could bring his power to bear and the seventh city was saved. That is why seven is a lucky number, and why we celebrate on Caenin.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Encanis was now hard pressed and bent his whole thought upon escape. But on the eighth day Tehlu did not pause to sleep or eat. And thus it was that at the end of Felling Tehlu caught Encanis. He leaped on the demon and struck him with his forge hammer. Encanis fell like a stone, but Tehlu’s hammer shattered and lay in the dust of the road.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu carried the demon’s limp body all through the long night, and on the morning of the ninth day he came to the city of Atur. When men saw Tehlu carrying the demon’s senseless form, they thought Encanis dead. But Tehlu knew that such a thing was not easily done. No simple blade or blow could kill him. No cell of bars could keep him safe within.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So Tehlu carried Encanis to the smithy. He called for iron, and people brought all they owned. Though he had taken no rest nor a morsel of food, all through the ninth day Tehlu labored. While ten men worked the bellows, Tehlu forged the great iron wheel.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">All night he worked, and when the first light of the tenth morning touched him, Tehlu struck the wheel one final time and it was finished. Wrought all of black iron, the wheel stood taller than a man. It had six spokes, each thicker than a hammer’s haft, and its rim was a handspan across. It weighed as much as forty men, and was cold to the touch. The sound of its name was terrible, and none could speak it.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Tehlu gathered the people who were watching and chose a priest among them. Then he set them to dig a great pit in the center of the town, fifteen feet wide and twenty feet deep.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">With the sun rising Tehlu laid the body of the demon on the wheel. At the first touch of iron, Encanis began to stir in his sleep. But Tehlu chained him tightly to the wheel, hammering the links together, sealing them tighter than any lock.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then Tehlu stepped back, and all saw Encanis shift again, as if disturbed by an unpleasant dream. Then he shook and came awake entirely. Encanis strained against the chains, his body arching upward as he pulled against them. Where the iron touched his skin it felt like knives and needles and nails, like the searing pain of frost, like the sting of a hundred biting flies. Encanis thrashed on the wheel and began to howl as the iron burned and bit and froze him.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">To Tehlu the sound was like a sweet music. He lay down on the ground beside the wheel and slept a deep sleep, for he was very tired.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When he awoke, it was evening of the tenth day. Encanis was still bound to the wheel, but he no longer howled and fought like a trapped animal. Tehlu bent and with great effort lifted one edge of the wheel and set it leaning against a tree that grew nearby. As soon as he came close, Encanis cursed him in languages no one knew, scratching and biting.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“You brought this on yourself,” Tehlu said.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">That night there was a celebration. Tehlu sent men to cut a dozen evergreens and use them to kindle a bonfire in the bottom of the deep pit they had dug.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">All night the townsfolk danced and sang around the burning fire. They knew the last and most dangerous of the world’s demons was finally caught.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">And all night Encanis hung from his wheel and watched them, motionless as a snake.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When the morning of the eleventh day came, Tehlu went to Encanis a third and final time. The demon looked worn and feral. His skin was sallow and his bones pressed tight against his skin. But his power still lay around him like a dark mantle, hiding his face in shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Encanis,” Tehlu said. “This is your last chance to speak. Do it, for I know it is within your power.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Lord Tehlu, I am not Encanis.” For that brief moment the demon’s voice was pitiful, and all who heard it were moved to sorrow. But then there was a sound like quenching iron, and the wheel rung like an iron bell. Encanis’ body arched painfully at the sound then hung limply from his wrists as the ringing of the wheel faded.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Try no tricks, dark one. Speak no lies,” Tehlu said sternly, his eyes as dark and hard as the iron of the wheel.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“What then?” Encanis hissed, his voice like the rasp of stone on stone. “What? Rack and shatter you, what do you want of me?”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Your road is very short, Encanis. But you may still choose a side on which to travel.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Encanis laughed. “You will give me the same choice you give the cattle? Yes then, I will cross to your side of the path, I regret and rep-”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The wheel rung again, like a great bell tolling long and deep. Encanis threw his body tight against the chains again and the sound of his scream shook the earth and shattered stones for half a mile in each direction.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">When the sounds of wheel and scream had faded, Encanis hung panting and shaking from his chains. “I told you to speak no lie, Encanis,” Tehlu said, pitiless.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“My path then!” Encanis shrieked. “I do not regret! If I had my choice again, I would only change how fast I ran. Your people are like cattle my kind feed on! Bite and break you, if you gave me half an hour I would do such things that these wretched gawping peasants would go mad with fear. I would drink their children’s blood and bathe in women’s tears.” He might have said more, but his breath was short as he strained against the chains that held him.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“So,” Tehlu said, and stepped close to the wheel. For a moment it seemed like he would embrace Encanis, but he was merely reaching for the iron spokes of the wheel. Then, straining, Tehlu lifted the wheel above his head. He carried it, arms upstretched, toward the pit, and threw Encanis in.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Through the long hours of night, a dozen evergreens had fed the fire. The flames had died in the early morning, leaving a deep bed of sullen coals that glimmered when the wind brushed them.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">The wheel struck flat, with Encanis on top. There was an explosion of spark and ash as it landed and sank inches deep into the hot coals. Encanis was held over the coals by the iron that bound and burned and bit at him.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Though he was held away from the fire itself, the heat was so intense that Encanis’ clothes charred black and began to crumble without bursting into flame. The demon thrashed against his bonds, settling the wheel more firmly into the coals. Encanis screamed, because he knew that even demons can die from fire or iron. And though he was powerful, he was bound and burning. He felt the metal of the wheel grow hot beneath him, blackening the flesh of his arms and legs. Encanis screamed, and even as his skin began to smoke and char, his face was still hidden in a shadow that rose from him like a tongue of darkening flame.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then Encanis grew silent, and the only sound was the hiss of sweat and blood as they fell from the demon’s straining limbs. For a long moment everything was still. Encanis strained against the chains that held him to the wheel, and it seemed that he would strain until his muscles tore themselves from bone and sinew both.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Then there was a sharp sound like a bell breaking and the demon’s arm jerked free of the wheel. Links of chain, now glowing red from the heat of the fire, flew upward to land smoking at the feet of those who stood above. The only sound was the sudden, wild laughter of Encanis, like breaking glass.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">In a moment the demon’s second hand was free, but before he could do more, Tehlu flung himself into the pit and landed with such force that the iron rang with it. Tehlu grabbed the hands of the demon and pressed them back against the wheel.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Encanis screamed in fury and in disbelief, for though he was forced back onto the burning wheel, and though he felt the strength of Tehlu was greater than chains he had broken, he saw Tehlu was burning in the flames.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Fool!” he wailed. “You will die here with me. Let me go and live. Let me go and I will trouble you no further.” And the wheel did not ring out, for Encanis was truly frightened.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“No,” said Tehlu. “Your punishment is death. You will serve it.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“Fool! Madling!” Encanis thrashed to no avail. “You are burning in the flames with me, you will die as I do!”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">“To ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn. But I am Tehlu. Son of myself. Father of myself. I was before, and I will be after. If I am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone. And if I am needed and called in the proper ways then I will come again to judge and punish.”</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">So Tehlu held him to the burning wheel, and none of the demon’s threats or screaming moved him the least part of an inch. So it was that Encanis passed from the world, and with him went Tehlu who was Menda. Both of them burned to ash in the pit in Atur. That is why the Tehlin priests wear robes of ashen grey. And that is how we know Tehlu cares for us, and watches us, and keeps us safe from-</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">Trapis broke off his story as Jaspin began to howl and thrash against his restraints. I slid softly back into unconsciousness as soon as I no longer had the story to hold my attention.</span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">After that, I began to harbor a suspicion that never entirely left me. Was Trapis a Tehlin priest? His robe was tattered and dirty, but it might have been the proper grey long ago. Parts of his story had been awkward and stumbling, but some were stately and grand, as if he had been reciting them from some half-forgotten memory. Of sermons? Of his readings from the</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre6"> Book of the Path?</span></span></p><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">I never asked. And though I stopped by his basement frequently in the months that followed, I never heard Trapis tell another story again.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_27"></div></div>
