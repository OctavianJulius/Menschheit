Lord and lady, it’s beautiful as anything these hands have ever made.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">A small line formed between the innkeeper’s eyebrows. Then, seeing the flat bundle in the man’s arms, he brightened. “Ahhh! The mounting board!” Kote smiled tiredly. “I’m sorry Graham. It’s been so long. I’d almost forgotten.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham gave him a bit of a strange look. “Four month ain’t long for wood all the way from Aryen, not with the roads being as bad as they are.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Four months,” Kote echoed. He saw Graham watching him and hurried to add, “That can be a lifetime if you’re waiting for something.” He tried to smile reassuringly, but it came out sickly.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">In fact, Kote himself seemed rather sickly. Not exactly unhealthy, but hollow. Wan. Like a plant that’s been moved into the wrong sort of soil and, lacking something vital, has begun to wilt.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham noted the difference. The innkeeper’s gestures weren’t as extravagant. His voice wasn’t as deep. Even his eyes weren’t as bright as they had been a month ago. Their color seemed duller. They were less sea-foam, less green-grass than they had been. Now they were like riverweed, like the bottom of a green glass bottle. And his hair had been bright before, the color of flame. Now it seemed-red. Just red-hair color, really.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote drew back the cloth and looked underneath. The wood was a dark charcoal color with a black grain, heavy as a sheet of iron. Three dark pegs were set above a word chiseled into the wood.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">“Folly,”</span></span><span class="calibre11"> Graham read. “Odd name for a sword.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote nodded, his face carefully blank. “How much do I owe you?” he asked quietly.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham thought for a moment. “After what ye’ve given me to cover the cost of the wood…” There was a cunning glimmer in the man’s eye. “Around one and three.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote handed over two talents. “Keep the rest. It’s difficult wood to work with.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“That it is,” Graham said with some satisfaction. “Like stone under the saw. Try a chisel, like iron. Then, after all the shouting was done, I couldn’t char it.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I noticed that,” Kote said with a flicker of curiosity, running a finger along the darker groove the letters made in the wood. “How did you manage it?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Well,” Graham said smugly, “after wasting half a day, I took it over to the smithy. Me and the boy managed to sear it with a hot iron. Took us better than two hours to get it black. Not a wisp of smoke, but it made a stink like old leather and clover. Damnedest thing. What sort of wood don’t burn?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham waited a minute, but the innkeeper gave no signs of having heard. “Where would’e like me to hang it then?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote roused himself enough to look around the room. “You can leave that to me, I think. I haven’t quite decided where to put it.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham left a handful of iron nails and bid the innkeeper good day. Kote remained at the bar, idly running his hands over the wood and the word. Before too long Bast came out of the kitchen and looked over his teacher’s shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">There was a long moment of silence like a tribute given to the dead.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Eventually, Bast spoke up. “May I ask a question, Reshi?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote smiled gently. “Always, Bast.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“A troublesome question?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Those tend to be the only worthwhile kind.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">They remained staring at the object on the bar for another silent moment, as if trying to commit it to memory.</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> Folly.</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Bast struggled for a moment, opening his mouth, then closing it with a frustrated look, then repeating the process.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Out with it,” Kote said finally.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“What were you thinking?” Bast said with an odd mixture of confusion and concern.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote was a long while in answering. “I tend to think too much, Bast. My greatest successes came from decisions I made when I stopped thinking and simply did what felt right. Even if there was no good explanation for what I did.” He smiled wistfully. “Even if there were very good reasons for me</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> not</span></span><span class="calibre11"> to do what I did.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Bast ran a hand along the side of his face. “So you’re trying to avoid second-guessing yourself?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote hesitated. “You could say that,” he admitted.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">I</span></span><span class="calibre11"> could say that, Reshi,” Bast said smugly. “You, on the other hand, would complicate things needlessly.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote shrugged and turned his eyes back to the mounting board. “Nothing to do but find a place for it, I suppose.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Out here?” Bast’s expression was horrified.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote grinned wickedly, a measure of vitality coming back into his face. “Of course,” he said, seeming to savor Bast’s reaction. He looked speculatively at the walls and pursed his lips. “Where did you put it, anyway?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“In my room,” Bast admitted. “Under my bed.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote nodded distractedly, still looking at the walls. “Go get it then.” He made a small shooing gesture with one hand, and Bast hurried off, looking unhappy.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The bar was decorated with glittering bottles, and Kote was standing on the now-vacant counter between the two heavy oak barrels when Bast came back into the room, black scabbard swinging loosely from one hand.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote paused in the act of setting the mounting board atop one of the barrels and cried out in dismay, “Careful, Bast! You’re carrying a lady there, not swinging some wench at a barn dance.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Bast stopped in his tracks and dutifully gathered it up in both hands before walking the rest of the way to the bar.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote pounded a pair of nails into the wall, twisted some wire, and hung the mounting board firmly on the wall. “Hand it up, would you?” he asked with an odd catch in his voice.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Using both hands, Bast held it up to him, looking for a moment like a squire offering up a sword to some bright-armored knight. But there was no knight there, just an innkeeper, just a man in an apron who called himself Kote. He took the sword from Bast and stood upright on the counter behind the bar.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">He drew the sword without a flourish. It shone a dull grey-white in the room’s autumn light. It had the appearance of a new sword. It was not notched or rusted. There were no bright scratches skittering along its dull grey side. But though it was unmarred, it was old. And while it was obviously a sword, it was not a familiar shape. At least no one in this town would have found it familiar. It looked as if an alchemist had distilled a dozen swords, and when the crucible had cooled this was lying in the bottom: a sword in its pure form. It was slender and graceful. It was deadly as a sharp stone beneath swift water.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote held it a moment. His hand did not shake.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Then he set the sword on the mounting board. Its grey-white metal shone against the dark roah behind it. While the handle could be seen, it was dark enough to be almost indistinguishable from the wood. The word beneath it, black against blackness, seemed to reproach:</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> Folly</span></span><span class="calibre11">.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote climbed down, and for a moment he and Bast stood side by side, silently looking up.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Bast broke the silence. “It</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> is</span></span><span class="calibre11"> rather striking,” he said, as if he regretted the truth. “But…” He trailed off, trying to find appropriate words. He shuddered.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote clapped him on the back, oddly cheerful. “Don’t bother being disturbed on my account.” He seemed more lively now, as if his activity lent him energy. “I like it,” he said with sudden conviction, and hung the black scabbard from one of the mounting board’s pegs.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Then there were things to be done. Bottles to be polished and put back in place. Lunch to be made. Lunch clutter to be cleaned. Things were cheerful for a while in a pleasant, bustling way. The two talked of small matters as they worked. And while they moved around a great deal, it was obvious they were reluctant to finish whatever task they were close to completing, as if they both dreaded the moment when the work would end and the silence would fill the room again.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Then something odd happened. The door opened and noise poured into the Waystone like a gentle wave. People bustled in, talking and dropping bundles of belongings. They chose tables and threw their coats over the backs of chairs. One man, wearing a shirt of heavy metal rings, unbuckled a sword and leaned it against a wall. Two or three wore knives on their belts. Four or five called for drinks.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote and Bast watched for a moment, then moved smoothly into action. Kote smiled and began pouring drinks. Bast darted outside to see if there were horses that needed stabling.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">In ten minutes the inn was a different place. Coins rang on the bar. Cheese and fruit were set on platters and a large copper pot was hung to simmer in the kitchen. Men moved tables and chairs about to better suit their group of nearly a dozen people.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote identified them as they came in. Two men and two women, wagoneers, rough from years of being outside and smiling to be spending a night out of the wind. Three guards with hard eyes, smelling of iron. A tinker with a potbelly and a ready smile showing his few remaining teeth. Two young men, one sandy-haired, one dark, well dressed and well-spoken: travelers sensible enough to hook up with a larger group for protection on the road.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The settling-in period lasted an hour or two. Prices of rooms were dickered over. Friendly arguments started about who slept with whom. Minor necessities were brought in from wagons or saddlebags. Baths were requested and water heated. Hay was taken to the horses, and Kote topped off the oil in all the lamps.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The tinker hurried outside to make use of the remaining daylight. He walked his two-wheel mule cart through the town’s streets. Children crowded around, begging for candy and stories and shims.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">When it became apparent that nothing was going to be handed out, most of them lost interest. They formed a circle with a boy in the middle and started to clap, keeping the beat with a children’s song that had been ages old when their grandparents had chanted it:</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">“When the hearthfire turns to blue,</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">What to do? What to do?</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Run outside. Run and hide.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Laughing, the boy in the middle tried to break out of the circle while the other children pushed him back.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Tinker,” the old man’s voice rang out like a bell. “Pot mender. Knife grinder. Willow-wand water-finder. Cut cork. Motherleaf. Silk scarves off the city streets. Writing paper. Sweetmeats.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">This drew the attention of the children. They flocked back to him, making a small parade as he walked down the street, singing, “Belt leather. Black pepper. Fine lace and bright feather. Tinker in town tonight, gone tomorrow. Working through the evening light. Come wife. Come daughter, I’ve small cloth and rose water.” After a couple of minutes he settled outside the Waystone, set up his sharpening wheel and began to grind a knife.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">As the adults began to gather around the old man, the children returned to their game. A girl in the center of the circle put one hand over her eyes and tried to catch the other children as they ran away, clapping and chanting:</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">“When his eyes are black as crow?</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Where to go? Where to go?</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Near and far. Here they are.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The tinker dealt with everyone in turn, sometimes two or three at a time. He traded sharp knives for dull ones and a small coin. He sold shears and needles, copper pots and small bottles that wives hid quickly after buying them. He traded buttons and bags of cinnamon and salt. Limes from Tinuë, chocolate from Tarbean, polished horn from Aerueh…</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">All the while the children continued to sing:</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">“See a man without a face?</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Move like ghosts from place to place.</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">What’s their plan? What’s their plan?</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Chandrian. Chandrian.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote guessed the travelers had been together a month or so, long enough to become comfortable with each other, but not long enough to be squabbling over small things. They smelled of road dust and horses. He breathed it in like perfume.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Best of all was the noise. Leather creaking. Men laughing. The fire cracked and spat. The women flirted. Someone even knocked over a chair. For the first time in a long while there was no silence in the Waystone Inn. Or if there was, it was too faint to be noticed, or too well hidden.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote was in the middle of it all, always moving, like a man tending a large, complex machine. Ready with a drink just as a person called for it, he talked and listened in the right amounts. He laughed at jokes, shook hands, smiled, and whisked coins off the bar as if he truly needed the money.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Then, when the time for songs came and everyone had sung their favorites and still wanted more, Kote led them from behind the bar, clapping to keep a beat. With the fire shining in his hair, he sang “Tinker Tanner,” more verses than anyone had heard before, and no one minded in the least.</span></p><p class="calibre12"/></div>
