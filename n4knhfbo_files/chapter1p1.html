Five wasn’t much of a crowd, but five was as many as the Waystone ever saw these days, times being what they were.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Old Cob was filling his role as storyteller and advice dispensary. The men at the bar sipped their drinks and listened. In the back room a young innkeeper stood out of sight behind the door, smiling as he listened to the details of a familiar story.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“When he awoke, Taborlin the Great found himself locked in a high tower. They had taken his sword and stripped him of his tools: key, coin, and candle were all gone. But that weren’t even the worst of it, you see…” Cob paused for effect, “…cause the lamps on the wall were burning blue!”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham, Jake, and Shep nodded to themselves. The three friends had grown up together, listening to Cob’s stories and ignoring his advice.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Cob peered closely at the newer, more attentive member of his small audience, the smith’s prentice. “Do you know what that meant, boy?” Everyone called the smith’s prentice “boy” despite the fact that he was a hand taller than anyone there. Small towns being what they are, he would most likely remain “boy” until his beard filled out or he bloodied someone’s nose over the matter.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The boy gave a slow nod. “The Chandrian.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“That’s right,” Cob said approvingly. “The Chandrian. Everyone knows that blue fire is one of their signs. Now he was-”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“But how’d they find him?” the boy interrupted. “And why din’t they kill him when they had the chance?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Hush now, you’ll get all the answers before the end,” Jake said. “Just let him tell it.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“No need for all that, Jake,” Graham said. “Boy’s just curious. Drink your drink.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I drank me drink already,” Jake grumbled. “I need t’nother but the innkeep’s still skinning rats in the back room.” He raised his voice and knocked his empty mug hollowly on the top of the mahogany bar. “Hoy! We’re thirsty men in here!”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper appeared with five bowls of stew and two warm, round loaves of bread. He pulled more beer for Jake, Shep, and Old Cob, moving with an air of bustling efficiency.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The story was set aside while the men tended to their dinners. Old Cob tucked away his bowl of stew with the predatory efficiency of a lifetime bachelor. The others were still blowing steam off their bowls when he finished the last of his loaf and returned to his story.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Now Taborlin needed to escape, but when he looked around, he saw his cell had no door. No windows. All around him was nothing but smooth, hard stone. It was a cell no man had ever escaped.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“But Taborlin knew the names of all things, and so all things were his to command. He said to the stone:</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> ‘Break!’</span></span><span class="calibre11"> and the stone broke. The wall tore like a piece of paper, and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and breathe the sweet spring air. He stepped to the edge, looked down, and without a second thought he stepped out into the open air…”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The boy’s eyes went wide. “He didn’t!”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Cob nodded seriously. “So Taborlin fell, but he did not despair. For he knew the name of the wind, and so the wind obeyed him. He spoke to the wind and it cradled and caressed him. It bore him to the ground as gently as a puff of thistledown and set him on his feet softly as a mother’s kiss.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“And when he got to the ground and felt his side where they’d stabbed him, he saw that it weren’t hardly a scratch. Now maybe it was just a piece of luck,” Cob tapped the side of his nose knowingly. “Or maybe it had something to do with the amulet he was wearing under his shirt.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“What amulet?” the boy asked eagerly through a mouthful of stew.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Old Cob leaned back on his stool, glad for the chance to elaborate. “A few days earlier, Taborlin had met a tinker on the road. And even though Taborlin didn’t have much to eat, he shared his dinner with the old man.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Right sensible thing to do,” Graham said quietly to the boy. “Everyone knows: ‘A tinker pays for kindness twice.’”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“No no,” Jake grumbled. “Get it right: ‘A tinker’s advice pays kindness twice.’”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper spoke up for the first time that night. “Actually, you’re missing more than half,” he said, standing in the doorway behind the bar.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">“A tinker’s debt is always paid:</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Once for any simple trade.</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Twice for freely-given aid.</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Twice for freely-given aid.</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">Thrice for any insult made.”</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The men at the bar seemed almost surprised to see Kote standing there. They’d been coming to the Waystone every Felling night for months and Kote had never interjected anything of his own before. Not that you could expect anything else, really. He’d only been in town for a year or so. He was still a stranger. The smith’s prentice had lived here since he was eleven, and he was still referred to as “that Rannish boy,” as if Rannish were some foreign country and not a town less than thirty miles away.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Just something I heard once,” Kote said to fill the silence, obviously embarrassed.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Old Cob nodded before he cleared his throat and launched back into the story. “Now this amulet was worth a whole bucket of gold nobles, but on account of Taborlin’s kindness, the tinker sold it to him for nothing but an iron penny, a copper penny, and a silver penny. It was black as a winter night and cold as ice to touch, but so long as it was round his neck, Taborlin would be safe from the harm of evil things. Demons and such.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I’d give a good piece for such a thing these days,” Shep said darkly. He had drunk most and talked least over the course of the evening. Everyone knew that something bad had happened out on his farm last Cendling night, but since they were good friends they knew better than to press him for the details. At least not this early in the evening, not as sober as they were.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Aye, who wouldn’t?” Old Cob said judiciously, taking a long drink.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I din’t know the Chandrian were demons,” the boy said. “I’d heard-”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“They ain’t demons,” Jake said firmly. “They were the first six people to refuse Tehlu’s choice of the path, and he cursed them to wander the corners-”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Are you telling this story, Jacob Walker?” Cob said sharply. “Cause if you are, I’ll just let you get on with it.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The two men glared at each other for a long moment. Eventually Jake looked away, muttering something that could, conceivably, have been an apology.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Cob turned back to the boy. “That’s the mystery of the Chandrian,” he explained. “Where do they come from? Where do they go after they’ve done their bloody deeds? Are they men who sold their souls? Demons? Spirits? No one knows.” Cob shot Jake a profoundly disdainful look. “Though every half-wit</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> claims</span></span><span class="calibre11"> he knows…”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The story fell further into bickering at this point, about the nature of the Chandrian, the signs that showed their presence to the wary, and whether the amulet would protect Taborlin from bandits, or mad dogs, or falling off a horse. Things were getting heated when the front door banged open.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Jake looked over. “It’s about time you got in, Carter. Tell this damn fool the difference between a demon and a dog. Everybody kn-” Jake stopped midsentence and rushed to the door. “God’s body, what happened to you?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Carter stepped into the light, his face pale and smeared with blood. He clutched an old saddle blanket to his chest. It was an odd, awkward shape, as if it were wrapped around a tangle of kindling sticks.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">His friends jumped off their stools and hurried over at the sight of him. “I’m fine,” he said as he made his slow way into the common room. His eyes were wild around the edges, like a skittish horse. “I’m fine. I’m fine.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">He dropped the bundled blanket onto the nearest table where it knocked hard against the wood, as if it were full of stones. His clothes were crisscrossed with long, straight cuts. His grey shirt hung in loose tatters except where it was stuck to his body, stained a dark, sullen red.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Graham tried to ease him into a chair. “Mother of God. Sit down, Carter. What happened to you? Sit down.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Carter shook his head stubbornly. “I told you, I’m fine. I’m not hurt that bad.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“How many were there?” Graham said.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“One,” Carter said. “But it’s not what you think-”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Goddammit. I told you, Carter,” Old Cob burst out with the sort of frightened anger only relatives and close friends can muster. “I told you for months now. You can’t go out alone. Not even as far as Baedn. It ain’t safe.” Jake laid a hand on the old man’s arm, quieting him.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Just take a sit,” Graham said, still trying to steer Carter into a chair. “Let’s get that shirt off you and get you cleaned up.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Carter shook his head. “I’m fine. I got cut up a little, but the blood is mostly Nelly’s. It jumped on her. Killed her about two miles outside town, past the Oldstone Bridge.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">A moment of serious silence followed the news. The smith’s prentice laid a sympathetic hand on Carter’s shoulder. “Damn. That’s hard. She was gentle as a lamb, too. Never tried to bite or kick when you brought her in for shoes. Best horse in town. Damn. I’m…” He trailed off. “Damn. I don’t know what to say.” He looked around helplessly.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Cob finally managed to free himself from Jake. “I told you,” he repeated, shaking a finger in Carter’s direction. “There’s folks out lately that would kill you for a pair of pennies, let alone a horse and cart. What are you going to do now? Pull it yourself?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">There was a moment of uncomfortable quiet. Jake and Cob glared at each other while the rest seemed at a loss for words, unsure of how to comfort their friend.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper moved carefully through the silence. Arms full, he stepped nimbly around Shep and began to arrange some items on a nearby table: a bowl of hot water, shears, some clean linen, a few glass bottles, needle and gut.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“This never would have happened if he’d listened to me in the first place,” Old Cob muttered. Jake tried to quiet him, but Cob brushed him aside. “I’m just tellin’ the truth. It’s a damn shame about Nelly, but he better listen now or he’ll end up dead. You don’t get lucky twice with those sort of men.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Carter’s mouth made a thin line. He reached out and pulled the edge of the bloody blanket. Whatever was inside flipped over once and snagged on the cloth. Carter tugged harder and there was a clatter like a bag of flat river stones upended onto the tabletop.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">It was a spider as large as a wagon wheel, black as slate.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The smith’s prentice jumped backward and hit a table, knocking it over and almost falling to the ground himself. Cob’s face went slack. Graham, Shep, and Jake made wordless, startled sounds and moved away, raising their hands to their faces. Carter took a step backward that was almost like a nervous twitch. Silence filled the room like a cold sweat.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper frowned. “They can’t have made it this far west yet,” he said softly.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">If not for the silence, it is unlikely anyone would have heard him. But they did. Their eyes pulled away from the thing on the table to stare mutely at the red-haired man.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Jake found his voice first. “You know what this is?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper’s eyes were distant. “Scrael,” he said distractedly. “I’d thought the mountains-”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Scrael?” Jake broke in. “Blackened body of God, Kote. You’ve seen these things before?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“What?” The red-haired innkeeper looked up sharply, as if suddenly remembering where he was. “Oh. No. No, of course not.” Seeing that he was the only one within arm’s length of the dark thing, he took a measured step away. “Just something I heard.” They stared at him. “Do you remember the trader that came through about two span ago?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">They all nodded. “Bastard tried to charge me ten pennies for a half-pound of salt,” Cob said reflexively, repeating the complaint for perhaps the hundredth time.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Wish I’d bought some,” Jake mumbled. Graham nodded a silent agreement.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“He was a filthy shim,” Cob spat, seeming to find comfort in the familiar words. “I might pay two in a tight time, but ten is robbery.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Not if there are more of those on the road,” Shep said darkly.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">All eyes went back to the thing on the table.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“He told me he’d heard of them over near Melcombe,” Kote said quickly, watching everyone’s faces as they studied the thing on the table. “I thought he was just trying to drive up his prices.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“What else did he say?” Carter asked.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper looked thoughtful for a moment, then shrugged. “I didn’t get the whole story. He was only in town for a couple hours.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I don’t like spiders,” the smith’s prentice said. He remained on the other side of a table some fifteen feet away. “Cover it up.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“It’s not a spider,” Jake said. “It’s got no eyes.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“It’s got no mouth either,” Carter pointed out. “How does it eat?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11">What</span></span><span class="calibre11"> does it eat?” Shep said darkly.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper continued to eye the thing curiously. He leaned closer, stretching out a hand. Everyone edged even farther away from the table.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Careful,” Carter said. “Its feet are sharp like knives.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“More like razors,” Kote said. His long fingers brushed the scrael’s black, featureless body. “It’s smooth and hard, like pottery.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Don’t go messing with it,” the smith’s prentice said.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Moving carefully, the innkeeper took one of the long, smooth legs and tried to break it with both hands like a stick. “Not pottery,” he amended. He set it against the edge of the table and leaned his weight against it. It broke with a sharp</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> crack.</span></span><span class="calibre11"> “More like stone.” He looked up at Carter. “How did it get all these cracks?” He pointed at the thin fractures that crazed the smooth black surface of the body.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Nelly fell on it,” Carter said. “It jumped out of a tree and started to climb all over her, cutting her up with its feet. It moved so fast. I didn’t even know what was going on.” Carter finally sank into the chair at Graham’s urging. “She got tangled in her harness and fell on it, broke some of its legs. Then it came after me, got on me, crawling all over.” He crossed his arms in front of his bloody chest and shuddered. “I managed to get it off me and stomped it hard as I could. Then it got on me again…” He trailed off, his face ashen.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper nodded to himself as he continued to prod the thing. “There’s no blood. No organs. It’s just grey inside.” He poked it with a finger. “Like a mushroom.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Great Tehlu, just leave it alone,” the smith’s prentice begged. “Sometimes spiders twitch after you kill them.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Listen to yourselves,” Cob said scathingly. “Spiders don’t get big as pigs. You know what this is.” He looked around, making eye contact with each of them. “It’s a demon.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">They looked at the broken thing. “Oh, come on now,” Jake said, disagreeing mostly out of habit. “It’s not like…” He made an inarticulate gesture. “It can’t just…”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Everyone knew what he was thinking. Certainly there were demons in the world. But they were like Tehlu’s angels. They were like heroes and kings. They belonged in stories. They belonged</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre11"> out there.</span></span><span class="calibre11"> Taborlin the Great called up fire and lightning to destroy demons. Tehlu broke them in his hands and sent them howling into the nameless void. Your childhood friend didn’t stomp one to death on the road to Baedn-Bryt. It was ridiculous.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Kote ran his hand through his red hair, then broke the silence. “There’s one way to tell for sure,” he said, reaching into his pocket. “Iron or fire.” He brought out a bulging leather purse.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“And the name of God,” Graham pointed out. “Demons fear three things: cold iron, clean fire, and the holy name of God.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper’s mouth pressed itself into a straight line that was not quite a frown. “Of course,” he said as he emptied his purse onto the table then fingered through the jumbled coins: heavy silver talents and thin silver bits, copper jots, broken ha’pennies, and iron drabs. “Does anyone have a shim?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Just use a drab,” Jake said. “That’s good iron.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I don’t want good iron,” the innkeeper said. “A drab has too much carbon in it. It’s almost steel.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“He’s right,” the smith’s prentice said. “Except it’s not carbon. You use coke to make steel. Coke and lime.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The innkeeper nodded deferentially to the boy. “You’d know best, young master. It’s your business after all.” His long fingers finally found a shim in the pile of coins. He held it up. “Here we are.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“What will it do?” Jake asked.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Iron kills demons,” Cob’s voice was uncertain, “but this one’s already dead. It might not do anything.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"/></div>
