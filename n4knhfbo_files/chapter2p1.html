<div id="filepos65210" class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4"></a><a id="filepos65215" class="calibre4"></a><p class="calibre5"><a href="The_Name_of_the_Wind_split_003.html#filepos1259" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre8"><span class="calibre9">CHAPTER TWO</span></span></span></span></a></p><p class="calibre10"><span class="bold1"><span class="calibre11">A Beautiful Day</span></span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">IT WAS ONE OF those perfect autumn days so common in stories and so rare in the real world. The weather was warm and dry, ideal for ripening a field of wheat or corn. On both sides of the road the trees were changing color. Tall poplars had gone a buttery yellow while the shrubby sumac encroaching on the road was tinged a violent red. Only the old oaks seemed reluctant to give up the summer, and their leaves remained an even mingling of gold and green.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Everything said, you couldn’t hope for a nicer day to have a half dozen ex-soldiers with hunting bows relieve you of everything you owned.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“She’s not much of a horse, sir,” Chronicler said. “One small step above a dray, and when it rains she-”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The man cut him off with a sharp gesture. “Listen friend, the king’s army is paying good money for anything with four legs and at least one eye. If you were stark mad and riding a hobbyhorse down the road, I’d still take it off you.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Their leader had an air of command about him. Chronicler guessed he had been a low ranking officer not long ago. “Just hop down,” he said seriously. “We’ll get this done with and you can be on your way.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Chronicler climbed down from his horse. He had been robbed before and knew when there was nothing to be gained by discussion. These fellows knew their business. No energy was wasted on bravado or idle threats. One of them looked over the horse, checking hooves, teeth, and harness. Two others went through his saddlebags with a military efficiency, laying all his worldly possessions out on the ground. Two blankets, a hooded cloak, the flat leather satchel, and his heavy, well-stocked travelsack.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“That’s all of it, Commander,” one of the men said. “Except for about twenty pounds of oats.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The commander knelt down and opened the flat leather satchel, peering inside.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“There’s nothing but paper and pens in there,” Chronicler said.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The commander turned to look backward over his shoulder. “You a scribe then?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Chronicler nodded. “It’s my livelihood, sir. And no real use to you.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The man looked through the satchel, found it to be true, and set it aside. Then he upended the travelsack onto Chronicler’s spread cloak and poked idly through the contents.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">He took most of Chronicler’s salt and a pair of bootlaces. Then, much to the scribe’s dismay, he picked up the shirt Chronicler had bought back in Linwood. It was fine linen dyed a deep, royal blue, too nice for traveling. Chronicler hadn’t even had the chance to wear it yet. He sighed.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The commander left everything else lying on the cloak and got to his feet. The others took turns going through Chronicler’s things.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The commander spoke up, “You only have one blanket, don’t you Janns?” One of the men nodded. “Take one of his then, you’ll need a second before winter’s through.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“His cloak is in better shape than mine, sir.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“Take it, but leave yours. The same for you, Witkins. Leave your old tinderbox if you’re taking his.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“I lost mine, sir,” Witkins said. “Else I would.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">The whole process was surprisingly civilized. Chronicler lost all of his needles but one, both extra pairs of socks, a bundle of dried fruit, a loaf of sugar, half a bottle of alcohol, and a pair of ivory dice. They left him the rest of his clothes, his dried meat, and a half-eaten loaf of incredibly stale rye bread. His flat leather satchel remained untouched.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">While the men repacked his travelsack, the commander turned to Chronicler. “Let’s have the purse then.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Chronicler handed it over.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“And the ring.”</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“There’s hardly any silver in it,” Chronicler mumbled as he unscrewed it from his finger.</span></p><p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">“What’s that around your neck?”</span></p><p class="calibre12"/></div>
