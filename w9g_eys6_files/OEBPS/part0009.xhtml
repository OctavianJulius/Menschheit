<div id="toc5_Chapter_One" class="class28">Chapter One</div>
<div class="calibre1">Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death.</div>
<div class="class29">Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.) But my mom believed I required treatment, so she took me to see <span id="page_4"></span>my Regular Doctor Jim, who agreed that I was veritably swimming in a paralyzing and totally clinical depression, and that therefore my meds should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group.</div>
<div class="class29">This Support Group featured a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumor-driven unwellness. Why did the cast rotate? A side effect of dying.</div>
<div class="class29">The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell. It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stone-walled Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been.</div>
<div class="class29">I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in Christ’s very sacred heart and whatever.</div>
<div class="class29">So here’s how it went in God’s heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked/wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story—how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didn’t die and now here he is, a full-grown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living <span id="page_5"></span>by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way toward a master’s degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life.</div>
<div class="class29">AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY!</div>
<div class="class29">Then we introduced ourselves: Name. Age. Diagnosis. And how we’re doing today. I’m Hazel, I’d say when they’d get to me. Sixteen. Thyroid originally but with an impressive and long-settled satellite colony in my lungs. And I’m doing okay.</div>
<div class="class29">Once we got around the circle, Patrick always asked if anyone wanted to share. And then began the circle jerk of support: everyone talking about fighting and battling and winning and shrinking and scanning. To be fair to Patrick, he let us talk about dying, too. But most of them weren’t dying. Most would live into adulthood, as Patrick had.</div>
<div class="class29">(Which meant there was quite a lot of competitiveness about it, with everybody wanting to beat not only cancer itself, but also the other people in the room. Like, I realize that this is irrational, but when they tell you that you have, say, a 20 percent chance of living five years, the math kicks in and you figure that’s one in five… so you look around and think, as any healthy person would: I gotta outlast four of these bastards.<span id="page_6"></span>)</div>
<div class="class29">The only redeeming facet of Support Group was this kid named Isaac, a long-faced, skinny guy with straight blond hair swept over one eye.</div>
<div class="class29">And his eyes were the problem. He had some fantastically improbable eye cancer. One eye had been cut out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick glasses that made his eyes (both the real one and the glass one) preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. From what I could gather on the rare occasions when Isaac shared with the group, a recurrence had placed his remaining eye in mortal peril.</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac and I communicated almost exclusively through sighs. Each time someone discussed anticancer diets or snorting ground-up shark fin or whatever, he’d glance over at me and sigh ever so slightly. I’d shake my head microscopically and exhale in response.</div>
<div class="class14">So Support Group blew, and after a few weeks, I grew to be rather kicking-and-screaming about the whole affair. In fact, on the Wednesday I made the acquaintance of Augustus Waters, I tried my level best to get out of Support Group while sitting on the couch with my mom in the third leg of a twelve-hour marathon of the previous season’s <span class="class13">America’s Next Top Model</span>, which admittedly I had already seen, but still<span id="page_7"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “I refuse to attend Support Group.”</div>
<div class="class29">Mom: “One of the symptoms of depression is disinterest in activities.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Please just let me watch <span class="class13">America’s Next Top Model</span>. It’s an activity.”</div>
<div class="class29">Mom: “Television is a passivity.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Ugh, Mom, please.”</div>
<div class="class29">Mom: “Hazel, you’re a teenager. You’re not a little kid anymore. You need to make friends, get out of the house, and live your life.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “If you want me to be a teenager, don’t send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs, drink vodka, and take pot.”</div>
<div class="class29">Mom: “You don’t <span class="class13">take</span> pot, for starters.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “See, that’s the kind of thing I’d know if you got me a fake ID.”</div>
<div class="class29">Mom: “You’re going to Support Group.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “UGGGGGGGGGGGGG.”</div>
<div class="class29">Mom: “Hazel, you deserve a life.”</div>
<div class="class29">That shut me up, although I failed to see how attendance at Support Group met the definition of <span class="class13">life</span>. Still, I agreed to go—after negotiating the right to record the 1.5 episodes of <span class="class13">ANTM</span> I’d be missing.</div>
<div class="class29">I went to Support Group for the same reason that I’d once allowed nurses with a mere eighteen months of graduate education to poison me with exotically named <span id="page_8"></span>chemicals: I wanted to make my parents happy. There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you’re sixteen, and that’s having a kid who bites it from cancer.</div>
<div class="class14">Mom pulled into the circular driveway behind the church at 4:56. I pretended to fiddle with my oxygen tank for a second just to kill time.</div>
<div class="class29">“Do you want me to carry it in for you?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No, it’s fine,” I said. The cylindrical green tank only weighed a few pounds, and I had this little steel cart to wheel it around behind me. It delivered two liters of oxygen to me each minute through a cannula, a transparent tube that split just beneath my neck, wrapped behind my ears, and then reunited in my nostrils. The contraption was necessary because my lungs sucked at being lungs.</div>
<div class="class29">“I love you,” she said as I got out.</div>
<div class="class29">“You too, Mom. See you at six.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Make friends!” she said through the rolled-down window as I walked away.</div>
<div class="class29">I didn’t want to take the elevator because taking the elevator is a Last Days kind of activity at Support Group, so I took the stairs. I grabbed a cookie and poured some lemonade into a Dixie cup and then turned around.</div>
<div class="class29">A boy was staring at me.</div>
<div class="class29">I was quite sure I’d never seen him before. Long and <span id="page_9"></span>leanly muscular, he dwarfed the molded plastic elementary school chair he was sitting in. Mahogany hair, straight and short. He looked my age, maybe a year older, and he sat with his tailbone against the edge of the chair, his posture aggressively poor, one hand half in a pocket of dark jeans.</div>
<div class="class29">I looked away, suddenly conscious of my myriad insufficiencies. I was wearing old jeans, which had once been tight but now sagged in weird places, and a yellow T-shirt advertising a band I didn’t even like anymore. Also my hair: I had this pageboy haircut, and I hadn’t even bothered to, like, brush it. Furthermore, I had ridiculously fat chipmunked cheeks, a side effect of treatment. I looked like a normally proportioned person with a balloon for a head. This was not even to mention the cankle situation. And yet—I cut a glance to him, and his eyes were still on me.</div>
<div class="class29">It occurred to me why they call it eye <span class="class13">contact</span>.</div>
<div class="class29">I walked into the circle and sat down next to Isaac, two seats away from the boy. I glanced again. He was still watching me.</div>
<div class="class29">Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy… well.</div>
<div class="class29">I pulled out my phone and clicked it so it would display the time: 4:59. The circle filled in with the unlucky twelve-to-eighteens, and then Patrick started us out with the serenity prayer: <span class="class13">God, grant me the serenity to accept the things <span id="page_10"></span>I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</span> The guy was still staring at me. I felt rather blushy.</div>
<div class="class29">Finally, I decided that the proper strategy was to stare back. Boys do not have a monopoly on the Staring Business, after all. So I looked him over as Patrick acknowledged for the thousandth time his ball-lessness etc., and soon it was a staring contest. After a while the boy smiled, and then finally his blue eyes glanced away. When he looked back at me, I flicked my eyebrows up to say, <span class="class13">I win</span>.</div>
<div class="class29">He shrugged. Patrick continued and then finally it was time for the introductions. “Isaac, perhaps you’d like to go first today. I know you’re facing a challenging time.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” Isaac said. “I’m Isaac. I’m seventeen. And it’s looking like I have to get surgery in a couple weeks, after which I’ll be blind. Not to complain or anything because I know a lot of us have it worse, but yeah, I mean, being blind does sort of suck. My girlfriend helps, though. And friends like Augustus.” He nodded toward the boy, who now had a name. “So, yeah,” Isaac continued. He was looking at his hands, which he’d folded into each other like the top of a tepee. “There’s nothing you can do about it.”</div>
<div class="class29">“We’re here for you, Isaac,” Patrick said. “Let Isaac hear it, guys.” And then we all, in a monotone, said, “We’re here for you, Isaac.”</div>
<div class="class29">Michael was next. He was twelve. He had leukemia. <span id="page_11"></span>He’d always had leukemia. He was okay. (Or so he said. He’d taken the elevator.)</div>
<div class="class29">Lida was sixteen, and pretty enough to be the object of the hot boy’s eye. She was a regular—in a long remission from appendiceal cancer, which I had not previously known existed. She said—as she had every other time I’d attended Support Group—that she felt <span class="class13">strong,</span> which felt like bragging to me as the oxygen-drizzling nubs tickled my nostrils.</div>
<div class="class29">There were five others before they got to him. He smiled a little when his turn came. His voice was low, smoky, and dead sexy. “My name is Augustus Waters,” he said. “I’m seventeen. I had a little touch of osteosarcoma a year and a half ago, but I’m just here today at Isaac’s request.”</div>
<div class="class29">“And how are you feeling?” asked Patrick.</div>
<div class="class29">“Oh, I’m grand.” Augustus Waters smiled with a corner of his mouth. “I’m on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.”</div>
<div class="class29">When it was my turn, I said, “My name is Hazel. I’m sixteen. Thyroid with mets in my lungs. I’m okay.”</div>
<div class="class29">The hour proceeded apace: Fights were recounted, battles won amid wars sure to be lost; hope was clung to; families were both celebrated and denounced; it was agreed that friends just didn’t get it; tears were shed; comfort proffered. Neither Augustus Waters nor I spoke again until Patrick said, “Augustus, perhaps you’d like to share your fears with the group.”</div>
<div class="class29">“My <span id="page_12"></span>fears?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I fear oblivion,” he said without a moment’s pause. “I fear it like the proverbial blind man who’s afraid of the dark.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Too soon,” Isaac said, cracking a smile.</div>
<div class="class29">“Was that insensitive?” Augustus asked. “I can be pretty blind to other people’s feelings.”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac was laughing, but Patrick raised a chastening finger and said, “Augustus, please. Let’s return to <span class="class13">you</span> and <span class="class13">your</span> struggles. You said you fear oblivion?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I did,” Augustus answered.</div>
<div class="class29">Patrick seemed lost. “Would, uh, would anyone like to speak to that?”</div>
<div class="class29">I hadn’t been in proper school in three years. My parents were my two best friends. My third best friend was an author who did not know I existed. I was a fairly shy person—not the hand-raising type.</div>
<div class="class29">And yet, just this once, I decided to speak. I half raised my hand and Patrick, his delight evident, immediately said, “Hazel!” I was, I’m sure he assumed, opening up. Becoming Part Of The Group.</div>
<div class="class29">I looked over at Augustus Waters, who looked back at me. You could almost see through his eyes they were so blue. “There will come a time,” I said, “when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are <span id="page_13"></span>no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this”—I gestured encompassingly—“will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”</div>
<div class="class29">I’d learned this from my aforementioned third best friend, Peter Van Houten, the reclusive author of <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>, the book that was as close a thing as I had to a Bible. Peter Van Houten was the only person I’d ever come across who seemed to (a) understand what it’s like to be dying, and (b) not have died.</div>
<div class="class29">After I finished, there was quite a long period of silence as I watched a smile spread all the way across Augustus’s face—not the little crooked smile of the boy trying to be sexy while he stared at me, but his real smile, too big for his face. “Goddamn,” Augustus said quietly. “Aren’t you something else.”</div>
<div class="class29">Neither of us said anything for the rest of Support <span id="page_14"></span>Group. At the end, we all had to hold hands, and Patrick led us in a prayer. “Lord Jesus Christ, we are gathered here in Your heart, <span class="class13">literally in Your heart</span>, as cancer survivors. You and You alone know us as we know ourselves. Guide us to life and the Light through our times of trial. We pray for Isaac’s eyes, for Michael’s and Jamie’s blood, for Augustus’s bones, for Hazel’s lungs, for James’s throat. We pray that You might heal us and that we might feel Your love, and Your peace, which passes all understanding. And we remember in our hearts those whom we knew and loved who have gone home to you: Maria and Kade and Joseph and Haley and Abigail and Angelina and Taylor and Gabriel and…”</div>
<div class="class29">It was a long list. The world contains a lot of dead people. And while Patrick droned on, reading the list from a sheet of paper because it was too long to memorize, I kept my eyes closed, trying to think prayerfully but mostly imagining the day when my name would find its way onto that list, all the way at the end when everyone had stopped listening.</div>
<div class="class29">When Patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra together—LIVING OUR BEST LIFE TODAY—and it was over. Augustus Waters pushed himself out of his chair and walked over to me. His gait was crooked like his smile. He towered over me, but he kept his distance so I wouldn’t have to crane my neck to look him in the eye. “What’s your name?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel.<span id="page_15"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“No, your full name.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Um, Hazel Grace Lancaster.” He was just about to say something else when Isaac walked up. “Hold on,” Augustus said, raising a finger, and turned to Isaac. “That was actually worse than you made it out to be.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I told you it was bleak.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Why do you bother with it?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I don’t know. It kind of helps?”</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus leaned in so he thought I couldn’t hear. “She’s a regular?” I couldn’t hear Isaac’s comment, but Augustus responded, “I’ll say.” He clasped Isaac by both shoulders and then took a half step away from him. “Tell Hazel about clinic.”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac leaned a hand against the snack table and focused his huge eye on me. “Okay, so I went into clinic this morning, and I was telling my surgeon that I’d rather be deaf than blind. And he said, ‘It doesn’t work that way,’ and I was, like, ‘Yeah, I realize it doesn’t work that way; I’m just saying I’d rather be deaf than blind if I had the choice, which I realize I don’t have,’ and he said, ‘Well, the good news is that you won’t be deaf,’ and I was like, ‘Thank you for explaining that my eye cancer isn’t going to make me deaf. I feel so fortunate that an intellectual giant like yourself would deign to operate on me.’”</div>
<div class="class29">“He sounds like a winner,” I said. “I’m gonna try to get me some eye cancer just so I can make this guy’s acquaintance.<span id="page_16"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“Good luck with that. All right, I should go. Monica’s waiting for me. I gotta look at her a lot while I can.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Counterinsurgence tomorrow?” Augustus asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Definitely.” Isaac turned and ran up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus Waters turned to me. “Literally,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Literally?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“We are literally in the heart of Jesus,” he said. “I thought we were in a church basement, but we are literally in the heart of Jesus.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Someone should tell Jesus,” I said. “I mean, it’s gotta be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I would tell Him myself,” Augustus said, “but unfortunately I am literally stuck inside of His heart, so He won’t be able to hear me.” I laughed. He shook his head, just looking at me.</div>
<div class="class29">“What?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Nothing,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Why are you looking at me like that?”</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus half smiled. “Because you’re beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.” A brief awkward silence ensued. Augustus plowed through: “I mean, particularly given that, as you so deliciously pointed out, all of this will end in oblivion and everything.”</div>
<div class="class29">I kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was vaguely coughy and then said, “I’m not beau—<span id="page_17"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“You’re like a millennial Natalie Portman. Like <span class="class13">V for Vendetta</span> Natalie Portman.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Never seen it,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Really?” he asked. “Pixie-haired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and can’t help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble. It’s your autobiography, so far as I can tell.”</div>
<div class="class29">His every syllable flirted. Honestly, he kind of turned me on. I didn’t even know that guys <span class="class13">could</span> turn me on—not, like, in real life.</div>
<div class="class29">A younger girl walked past us. “How’s it going, Alisa?” he asked. She smiled and mumbled, “Hi, Augustus.” “Memorial people,” he explained. Memorial was the big research hospital. “Where do you go?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Children’s,” I said, my voice smaller than I expected it to be. He nodded. The conversation seemed over. “Well,” I said, nodding vaguely toward the steps that led us out of the Literal Heart of Jesus. I tilted my cart onto its wheels and started walking. He limped beside me. “So, see you next time, maybe?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“You should see it,” he said. “<span class="class13">V for Vendetta</span>, I mean.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Okay,” I said. “I’ll look it up.”</div>
<div class="class29">“No. With me. At my house,” he said. “Now.”</div>
<div class="class29">I stopped walking. “I hardly know you, Augustus Waters. You could be an ax murderer.”</div>
<div class="class29">He nodded. “True enough, Hazel Grace.” He walked past me, his shoulders filling out his green knit polo shirt, his back straight, his steps lilting just slightly to the right as <span id="page_18"></span>he walked steady and confident on what I had determined was a prosthetic leg. Osteosarcoma sometimes takes a limb to check you out. Then, if it likes you, it takes the rest.</div>
<div class="class29">I followed him upstairs, losing ground as I made my way up slowly, stairs not being a field of expertise for my lungs.</div>
<div class="class29">And then we were out of Jesus’s heart and in the parking lot, the spring air just on the cold side of perfect, the late-afternoon light heavenly in its hurtfulness.</div>
<div class="class29">Mom wasn’t there yet, which was unusual, because Mom was almost always waiting for me. I glanced around and saw that a tall, curvy brunette girl had Isaac pinned against the stone wall of the church, kissing him rather aggressively. They were close enough to me that I could hear the weird noises of their mouths together, and I could hear him saying, “Always,” and her saying, “Always,” in return.</div>
<div class="class29">Suddenly standing next to me, Augustus half whispered, “They’re big believers in PDA.”</div>
<div class="class29">“What’s with the ‘always’?” The slurping sounds intensified.</div>
<div class="class29">“Always is their thing. They’ll <span class="class13">always</span> love each other and whatever. I would conservatively estimate they have texted each other the word <span class="class13">always</span> four million times in the last year.”</div>
<div class="class29">A couple more cars drove up, taking Michael and Alisa away. It was just Augustus and me now, watching Isaac and Monica, who proceeded apace as if they were not leaning <span id="page_19"></span>against a place of worship. His hand reached for her boob over her shirt and pawed at it, his palm still while his fingers moved around. I wondered if that felt good. Didn’t seem like it would, but I decided to forgive Isaac on the grounds that he was going blind. The senses must feast while there is yet hunger and whatever.</div>
<div class="class29">“Imagine taking that last drive to the hospital,” I said quietly. “The last time you’ll ever drive a car.”</div>
<div class="class29">Without looking over at me, Augustus said, “You’re killing my vibe here, Hazel Grace. I’m trying to observe young love in its many-splendored awkwardness.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I think he’s hurting her boob,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Yes, it’s difficult to ascertain whether he is trying to arouse her or perform a breast exam.” Then Augustus Waters reached into a pocket and pulled out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes. He flipped it open and put a cigarette between his lips.</div>
<div class="class29">“Are you <span class="class13">serious</span>?” I asked. “You think that’s cool? Oh, my God, you just ruined <span class="class13">the whole thing</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Which whole thing?” he asked, turning to me. The cigarette dangled unlit from the unsmiling corner of his mouth.</div>
<div class="class29">“The whole thing where a boy who is not unattractive or unintelligent or seemingly in any way unacceptable stares at me and points out incorrect uses of literality and compares me to actresses and asks me to watch a movie at his house. But of course there is always a <span class="class13">hamartia</span> and yours <span id="page_20"></span>is that oh, my God, even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER. Oh, my God. Let me just assure you that not being able to breathe? SUCKS. Totally disappointing. <span class="class13">Totally</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">“A <span class="class13">hamartia</span>?” he asked, the cigarette still in his mouth. It tightened his jaw. He had a hell of a jawline, unfortunately.</div>
<div class="class29">“A fatal flaw,” I explained, turning away from him. I stepped toward the curb, leaving Augustus Waters behind me, and then I heard a car start down the street. It was Mom. She’d been waiting for me to, like, make friends or whatever.</div>
<div class="class29">I felt this weird mix of disappointment and anger welling up inside of me. I don’t even know what the feeling was, really, just that there was a <span class="class13">lot</span> of it, and I wanted to smack Augustus Waters and also replace my lungs with lungs that didn’t suck at being lungs. I was standing with my Chuck Taylors on the very edge of the curb, the oxygen tank ball-and-chaining in the cart by my side, and right as my mom pulled up, I felt a hand grab mine.</div>
<div class="class29">I yanked my hand free but turned back to him.</div>
<div class="class29">“They don’t kill you unless you light them,” he said as Mom arrived at the curb. “And I’ve never lit one. It’s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing.”</div>
<div class="class29">“It’s a metaphor,” I said, dubious. Mom was just idling<span id="page_21"></span>.</div>
