<div class="class28">Chapter Seven</div>
<div class="calibre1">I screamed to wake up my parents, and they burst into the room, but there was nothing they could do to dim the supernovae exploding inside my brain, an endless chain of intracranial firecrackers that made me think that I was once and for all going, and I told myself—as I’ve told myself before—that the body shuts down when the pain gets too bad, that consciousness is temporary, that this will pass. But just like always, I didn’t slip away. I was left on the shore with the waves washing over me, unable to drown.</div>
<div class="class29">Dad drove, talking on the phone with the hospital, while I lay in the back with my head in Mom’s lap. There was nothing to do: Screaming made it worse. All stimuli made it worse, actually<span id="page_106"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">The only solution was to try to unmake the world, to make it black and silent and uninhabited again, to return to the moment before the Big Bang, in the beginning when there was the Word, and to live in that vacuous uncreated space alone with the Word.</div>
<div class="class29">People talk about the courage of cancer patients, and I do not deny that courage. I had been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years, and still I trod on. But make no mistake: In that moment, I would have been very, very happy to die.</div>
<div class="class14">I woke up in the ICU. I could tell I was in the ICU because I didn’t have my own room, and because there was so much beeping, and because I was alone: They don’t let your family stay with you 24/7 in the ICU at Children’s because it’s an infection risk. There was wailing down the hall. Somebody’s kid had died. I was alone. I hit the red call button.</div>
<div class="class29">A nurse came in seconds later. “Hi,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hello, Hazel. I’m Alison, your nurse,” she said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hi, Alison My Nurse,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">Whereupon I started to feel pretty tired again. But I woke up a bit when my parents came in, crying and kissing my face repeatedly, and I reached up for them and tried to squeeze, but my everything hurt when I squeezed, and Mom and Dad told me that I did not have a brain tumor, but that my headache was caused by poor oxygenation, which was caused by my lungs swimming in fluid, a liter and a half (!!!!) of <span id="page_107"></span>which had been successfully drained from my chest, which was why I might feel a slight discomfort in my side, where there was, <span class="class13">hey look at that</span>, a tube that went from my chest into a plastic bladder half full of liquid that for all the world resembled my dad’s favorite amber ale. Mom told me I was going to go home, that I really was, that I would just have to get this drained every now and again and get back on the BiPAP, this nighttime machine that forces air in and out of my crap lungs. But I’d had a total body PET scan on the first night in the hospital, they told me, and the news was good: no tumor growth. No new tumors. My shoulder pain had been lack-of-oxygen pain. Heart-working-too-hard pain.</div>
<div class="class29">“Dr. Maria said this morning that she remains optimistic,” Dad said. I liked Dr. Maria, and she didn’t bullshit you, so that felt good to hear.</div>
<div class="class29">“This is just a thing, Hazel,” my mom said. “It’s a thing we can live with.”</div>
<div class="class29">I nodded, and then Alison My Nurse kind of politely made them leave. She asked me if I wanted some ice chips, and I nodded, and then she sat at the bed with me and spooned them into my mouth.</div>
<div class="class29">“So you’ve been gone a couple days,” Alison said. “Hmm, what’d you miss… A celebrity did drugs. Politicians disagreed. A different celebrity wore a bikini that revealed a bodily imperfection. A team won a sporting event, but another team lost.” I smiled. “You can’t go disappearing on <span id="page_108"></span>everybody like this, Hazel. You miss too much.”</div>
<div class="class29">“More?” I asked, nodding toward the white Styrofoam cup in her hand.</div>
<div class="class29">“I shouldn’t,” she said, “but I’m a rebel.” She gave me another plastic spoonful of crushed ice. I mumbled a thank-you. Praise God for good nurses. “Getting tired?” she asked. I nodded. “Sleep for a while,” she said. “I’ll try to run interference and give you a couple hours before somebody comes in to check vitals and the like.” I said Thanks again. You say thanks a lot in a hospital. I tried to settle into the bed. “You’re not gonna ask about your boyfriend?” she asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Don’t have one,” I told her.</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, there’s a kid who has hardly left the waiting room since you got here,” she said.</div>
<div class="class29">“He hasn’t seen me like this, has he?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No. Family only.”</div>
<div class="class29">I nodded and sank into an aqueous sleep.</div>
<div class="class14">It would take me six days to get home, six undays of staring at acoustic ceiling tile and watching television and sleeping and pain and wishing for time to pass. I did not see Augustus or anyone other than my parents. My hair looked like a bird’s nest; my shuffling gait like a dementia patient’s. I felt a little better each day, though: Each sleep ended to reveal a person who seemed a bit more like me. Sleep fights cancer, Regular Dr. Jim said for the thousandth time as he <span id="page_109"></span>hovered over me one morning surrounded by a coterie of medical students.</div>
<div class="class29">“Then I am a cancer-fighting machine,” I told him.</div>
<div class="class29">“That you are, Hazel. Keep resting, and hopefully we’ll get you home soon.”</div>
<div class="class14">On Tuesday, they told me I’d go home on Wednesday. On Wednesday, two minimally supervised medical students removed my chest tube, which felt like getting stabbed in reverse and generally didn’t go very well, so they decided I’d have to stay until Thursday. I was beginning to think that I was the subject of some existentialist experiment in permanently delayed gratification when Dr. Maria showed up on Friday morning, sniffed around me for a minute, and told me I was good to go.</div>
<div class="class29">So Mom opened her oversize purse to reveal that she’d had my Go Home Clothes with her all along. A nurse came in and took out my IV. I felt untethered even though I still had the oxygen tank to carry around with me. I went into the bathroom, took my first shower in a week, got dressed, and when I got out, I was so tired I had to lie down and get my breath. Mom asked, “Do you want to see Augustus?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I guess,” I said after a minute. I stood up and shuffled over to one of the molded plastic chairs against the wall, tucking my tank beneath the chair. It wore me out.</div>
<div class="class29">Dad came back with Augustus a few minutes later. His hair was messy, sweeping down over his forehead. He lit up <span id="page_110"></span>with a real Augustus Waters Goofy Smile when he saw me, and I couldn’t help but smile back. He sat down in the blue faux-leather recliner next to my chair. He leaned in toward me, seemingly incapable of stifling the smile.</div>
<div class="class29">Mom and Dad left us alone, which felt awkward. I worked hard to meet his eyes, even though they were the kind of pretty that’s hard to look at. “I missed you,” Augustus said.</div>
<div class="class29">My voice was smaller than I wanted it to be. “Thanks for not trying to see me when I looked like hell.”</div>
<div class="class29">“To be fair, you still look pretty bad.”</div>
<div class="class29">I laughed. “I missed you, too. I just don’t want you to see… all this. I just want, like… It doesn’t matter. You don’t always get what you want.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Is that so?” he asked. “I’d always thought the world was a wish-granting factory.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Turns out that is not the case,” I said. He was so beautiful. He reached for my hand but I shook my head. “No,” I said quietly. “If we’re gonna hang out, it has to be, like, not that.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Okay,” he said. “Well, I have good news and bad news on the wish-granting front.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Okay?” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“The bad news is that we obviously can’t go to Amsterdam until you’re better. The Genies will, however, work their famous magic when you’re well enough.<span id="page_111"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“That’s the good news?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No, the good news is that while you were sleeping, Peter Van Houten shared a bit more of his brilliant brain with us.”</div>
<div class="class29">He reached for my hand again, but this time to slip into it a heavily folded sheet of stationery on the letterhead of <span class="class13">Peter Van Houten, Novelist Emeritus</span>.</div>
<div class="class14">I didn’t read it until I got home, situated in my own huge and empty bed with no chance of medical interruption. It took me forever to decode Van Houten’s sloped, scratchy script.</div>
<div class="class39">Dear Mr. Waters,</div>
<div class="class40">I am in receipt of your electronic mail dated the 14th of April and duly impressed by the Shakespearean complexity of your tragedy. Everyone in this tale has a rock-solid <span class="class13">hamartia</span>: hers, that she is so sick; yours, that you are so well. Were she better or you sicker, then the stars would not be so terribly crossed, but it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he had Cassius note, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves.” Easy enough to say when you’re a Roman nobleman (or Shakespeare!), <span id="page_112"></span>but there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.</div>
<div class="class34"><span class="class9">While we’re on the topic of old Will’s insufficiencies, your writing about young Hazel reminds me of the Bard’s Fifty-fifth sonnet, which of course begins, “Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; / But you shall shine more bright in these contents / Than unswept stone, besmear’d with sluttish time.” (Off topic, but: What a slut time is. She screws everybody.) It’s a fine poem but a deceitful one: We do indeed remember Shakespeare’s powerful rhyme, but what do we remember about the person it commemorates? Nothing. We’re pretty sure he was male; everything else is guesswork. Shakespeare told us precious little of the man whom he entombed in his linguistic sarcophagus. (Witness also that when we talk about literature, we do so in the present tense. When we speak of the dead, we are not so kind.) You do not immortalize the lost by writing about them. Language buries, but does not resurrect. (Full disclosure: I am not the first to make this observation. cf, the MacLeish poem “Not Marble, Nor the Gilded Monuments,” which contains the heroic line “I shall say you will die and none will remember you.”</span><span id="page_113" class="class9"></span><span class="class9">)</span></div>
<div class="class36"><span class="class9">I digress, but here’s the rub: The dead are visible only in the terrible lidless eye of memory. The living, thank heaven, retain the ability to surprise and to disappoint. Your Hazel is alive, Waters, and you mustn’t impose your will upon another’s decision, particularly a decision arrived at thoughtfully. She wishes to spare you pain, and you should let her. You may not find young Hazel’s logic persuasive, but I have trod through this vale of tears longer than you, and from where I’m sitting, she’s not the lunatic.</span></div>
<div class="class33">Yours truly,<br class="calibre1"/>Peter Van Houten</div>
<div class="calibre1">It was really written by him. I licked my finger and dabbed the paper and the ink bled a little, so I knew it was really real.</div>
<div class="class29">“Mom,” I said. I did not say it loudly, but I didn’t have to. She was always waiting. She peeked her head around the door.</div>
<div class="class29">“You okay, sweetie?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Can we call Dr. Maria and ask if international travel would kill me?”</div>
