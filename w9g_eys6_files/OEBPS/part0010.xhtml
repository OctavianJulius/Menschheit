<div class="class28">Chapter Two</div>
<div class="calibre1">Augustus Waters drove horrifically. Whether stopping or starting, everything happened with a tremendous JOLT. I flew against the seat belt of his Toyota SUV each time he braked, and my neck snapped backward each time he hit the gas. I might have been nervous—what with sitting in the car of a strange boy on the way to his house, keenly aware that my crap lungs complicate efforts to fend off unwanted advances—but his driving was so astonishingly poor that I could think of nothing else.</div>
<div class="class29">We’d gone perhaps a mile in jagged silence before Augustus said, “I failed the driving test three times.”</div>
<div class="class29">“You don’t say.<span id="page_23"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">He laughed, nodding. “Well, I can’t feel pressure in old Prosty, and I can’t get the hang of driving left-footed. My doctors say most amputees can drive with no problem, but… yeah. Not me. Anyway, I go in for my fourth driving test, and it goes about like this is going.” A half mile in front of us, a light turned red. Augustus slammed on the brakes, tossing me into the triangular embrace of the seat belt. “Sorry. I swear to God I am trying to be gentle. Right, so anyway, at the end of the test, I totally thought I’d failed again, but the instructor was like, ‘Your driving is unpleasant, but it isn’t technically unsafe.’”</div>
<div class="class29">“I’m not sure I agree,” I said. “I suspect Cancer Perk.” Cancer Perks are the little things cancer kids get that regular kids don’t: basketballs signed by sports heroes, free passes on late homework, unearned driver’s licenses, etc.</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” he said. The light turned green. I braced myself. Augustus slammed the gas.</div>
<div class="class29">“You know they’ve got hand controls for people who can’t use their legs,” I pointed out.</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” he said. “Maybe someday.” He sighed in a way that made me wonder whether he was confident about the existence of <span class="class13">someday</span>. I knew osteosarcoma was highly curable, but still.</div>
<div class="class29">There are a number of ways to establish someone’s approximate survival expectations without actually <span class="class13">asking</span>. I used the classic: “So, are you in school?” Generally, your <span id="page_24"></span>parents pull you out of school at some point if they expect you to bite it.</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” he said. “I’m at North Central. A year behind, though: I’m a sophomore. You?”</div>
<div class="class29">I considered lying. No one likes a corpse, after all. But in the end I told the truth. “No, my parents withdrew me three years ago.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Three <span class="class13">years</span>?” he asked, astonished.</div>
<div class="class29">I told Augustus the broad outline of my miracle: diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer when I was thirteen. (I didn’t tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You’re a woman. Now die.) It was, we were told, incurable.</div>
<div class="class29">I had a surgery called <span class="class13">radical neck dissection</span>, which is about as pleasant as it sounds. Then radiation. Then they tried some chemo for my lung tumors. The tumors shrank, then grew. By then, I was fourteen. My lungs started to fill up with water. I was looking pretty dead—my hands and feet ballooned; my skin cracked; my lips were perpetually blue. They’ve got this drug that makes you not feel so completely terrified about the fact that you can’t breathe, and I had a lot of it flowing into me through a PICC line, and more than a dozen other drugs besides. But even so, there’s a certain unpleasantness to drowning, particularly when it occurs over the course of several months. I finally ended up in the ICU with pneumonia, and my mom knelt by the side <span id="page_25"></span>of my bed and said, “Are you ready, sweetie?” and I told her I was ready, and my dad just kept telling me he loved me in this voice that was not breaking so much as already broken, and I kept telling him that I loved him, too, and everyone was holding hands, and I couldn’t catch my breath, and my lungs were acting desperate, gasping, pulling me out of the bed trying to find a position that could get them air, and I was embarrassed by their desperation, disgusted that they wouldn’t just <span class="class13">let go</span>, and I remember my mom telling me it was okay, that I was okay, that I would be okay, and my father was trying so hard not to sob that when he did, which was regularly, it was an earthquake. And I remember wanting not to be awake.</div>
<div class="class29">Everyone figured I was finished, but my Cancer Doctor Maria managed to get some of the fluid out of my lungs, and shortly thereafter the antibiotics they’d given me for the pneumonia kicked in.</div>
<div class="class29">I woke up and soon got into one of those experimental trials that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for Not Working. The drug was Phalanxifor, this molecule designed to attach itself to cancer cells and slow their growth. It didn’t work in about 70 percent of people. But it worked in me. The tumors shrank.</div>
<div class="class29">And they stayed shrunk. Huzzah, Phalanxifor! In the past eighteen months, my mets have hardly grown, leaving me with lungs that suck at being lungs but could, <span id="page_26"></span>conceivably, struggle along indefinitely with the assistance of drizzled oxygen and daily Phalanxifor.</div>
<div class="class29">Admittedly, my Cancer Miracle had only resulted in a bit of purchased time. (I did not yet know the size of the bit.) But when telling Augustus Waters, I painted the rosiest possible picture, embellishing the miraculousness of the miracle.</div>
<div class="class29">“So now you gotta go back to school,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“I actually<span class="class13"> can’t</span>,” I explained, “because I already got my GED. So I’m taking classes at MCC,” which was our community college.</div>
<div class="class29">“A college girl,” he said, nodding. “That explains the aura of sophistication.” He smirked at me. I shoved his upper arm playfully. I could feel the muscle right beneath the skin, all tense and amazing.</div>
<div class="class29">We made a wheels-screeching turn into a subdivision with eight-foot-high stucco walls. His house was the first one on the left. A two-story colonial. We jerked to a halt in his driveway.</div>
<div class="class29">I followed him inside. A wooden plaque in the entryway was engraved in cursive with the words <span class="class13">Home Is Where the Heart Is</span>, and the entire house turned out to be festooned in such observations. <span class="class13">Good Friends Are Hard to Find and Impossible to Forget</span> read an illustration above the coatrack. <span class="class13">True Love Is Born from Hard Times</span> promised a needlepointed pillow in their antique-furnished living room. Augustus saw <span id="page_27"></span>me reading. “My parents call them Encouragements,” he explained. “They’re everywhere.”</div>
<div class="class14">His mom and dad called him Gus. They were making enchiladas in the kitchen (a piece of stained glass by the sink read in bubbly letters <span class="class13">Family Is Forever</span>). His mom was putting chicken into tortillas, which his dad then rolled up and placed in a glass pan. They didn’t seem too surprised by my arrival, which made sense: The fact that Augustus made me <span class="class13">feel</span> special did not necessarily indicate that I <span class="class13">was</span> special. Maybe he brought home a different girl every night to show her movies and feel her up.</div>
<div class="class29">“This is Hazel Grace,” he said, by way of introduction.</div>
<div class="class29">“Just Hazel,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“How’s it going, Hazel?” asked Gus’s dad. He was tall—almost as tall as Gus—and skinny in a way that parentally aged people usually aren’t.</div>
<div class="class29">“Okay,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“How was Isaac’s Support Group?”</div>
<div class="class29">“It was incredible,” Gus said.</div>
<div class="class29">“You’re such a Debbie Downer,” his mom said. “Hazel, do you enjoy it?”</div>
<div class="class29">I paused a second, trying to figure out if my response should be calibrated to please Augustus or his parents. “Most of the people are really nice,” I finally said.</div>
<div class="class29">“That’s exactly what we found with families at <span id="page_28"></span>Memorial when we were in the thick of it with Gus’s treatment,” his dad said. “Everybody was so kind. Strong, too. In the darkest days, the Lord puts the best people into your life.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Quick, give me a throw pillow and some thread because that needs to be an Encouragement,” Augustus said, and his dad looked a little annoyed, but then Gus wrapped his long arm around his dad’s neck and said, “I’m just kidding, Dad. I like the freaking Encouragements. I really do. I just can’t admit it because I’m a teenager.” His dad rolled his eyes.</div>
<div class="class29">“You’re joining us for dinner, I hope?” asked his mom. She was small and brunette and vaguely mousy.</div>
<div class="class29">“I guess?” I said. “I have to be home by ten. Also I don’t, um, eat meat?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No problem. We’ll vegetarianize some,” she said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Animals are just too cute?” Gus asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“I want to minimize the number of deaths I am responsible for,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">Gus opened his mouth to respond but then stopped himself.</div>
<div class="class29">His mom filled the silence. “Well, I think that’s wonderful.”</div>
<div class="class29">They talked to me for a bit about how the enchiladas were Famous Waters Enchiladas and Not to Be Missed and about how Gus’s curfew was also ten, and how they were <span id="page_29"></span>inherently distrustful of anyone who gave their kids curfews <span class="class13">other</span> than ten, and was I in school—“she’s a college student,” Augustus interjected—and how the weather was truly and absolutely extraordinary for March, and how in spring all things are new, and they didn’t even once ask me about the oxygen or my diagnosis, which was weird and wonderful, and then Augustus said, “Hazel and I are going to watch <span class="class13">V for Vendetta</span> so she can see her filmic doppelgänger, mid-two thousands Natalie Portman.”</div>
<div class="class29">“The living room TV is yours for the watching,” his dad said happily.</div>
<div class="class29">“I think we’re actually gonna watch it in the basement.”</div>
<div class="class29">His dad laughed. “Good try. Living room.”</div>
<div class="class29">“But I want to show Hazel Grace the basement,” Augustus said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Just Hazel,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“So show Just Hazel the basement,” said his dad. “And then come upstairs and watch your movie in the living room.”</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus puffed out his cheeks, balanced on his leg, and twisted his hips, throwing the prosthetic forward. “Fine,” he mumbled.</div>
<div class="class29">I followed him down carpeted stairs to a huge basement bedroom. A shelf at my eye level reached all the way around the room, and it was stuffed solid with basketball memorabilia: dozens of trophies with gold plastic men <span id="page_30"></span>mid–jump shot or dribbling or reaching for a layup toward an unseen basket. There were also lots of signed balls and sneakers.</div>
<div class="class29">“I used to play basketball,” he explained.</div>
<div class="class29">“You must’ve been pretty good.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I wasn’t bad, but all the shoes and balls are Cancer Perks.” He walked toward the TV, where a huge pile of DVDs and video games were arranged into a vague pyramid shape. He bent at the waist and snatched up <span class="class13">V for Vendetta</span>. “I was, like, the prototypical white Hoosier kid,” he said. “I was all about resurrecting the lost art of the midrange jumper, but then one day I was shooting free throws—just standing at the foul line at the North Central gym shooting from a rack of balls. All at once, I couldn’t figure out why I was methodically tossing a spherical object through a toroidal object. It seemed like the stupidest thing I could possibly be doing.</div>
<div class="class29">“I started thinking about little kids putting a cylindrical peg through a circular hole, and how they do it over and over again for months when they figure it out, and how basketball was basically just a slightly more aerobic version of that same exercise. Anyway, for the longest time, I just kept sinking free throws. I hit eighty in a row, my all-time best, but as I kept going, I felt more and more like a two-year-old. And then for some reason I started to think about hurdlers. Are you okay?<span id="page_31"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">I’d taken a seat on the corner of his unmade bed. I wasn’t trying to be suggestive or anything; I just got kind of tired when I had to stand a lot. I’d stood in the living room and then there had been the stairs, and then more standing, which was quite a lot of standing for me, and I didn’t want to faint or anything. I was a bit of a Victorian Lady, fainting-wise. “I’m fine,” I said. “Just listening. Hurdlers?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah, hurdlers. I don’t know why. I started thinking about them running their hurdle races, and jumping over these totally arbitrary objects that had been set in their path. And I wondered if hurdlers ever thought, you know, <span class="class13">This would go faster if we just got rid of the hurdles</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">“This was before your diagnosis?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Right, well, there was that, too.” He smiled with half his mouth. “The day of the existentially fraught free throws was coincidentally also my last day of dual leggedness. I had a weekend between when they scheduled the amputation and when it happened. My own little glimpse of what Isaac is going through.”</div>
<div class="class29">I nodded. I liked Augustus Waters. I really, really, really liked him. I liked the way his story ended with someone else. I liked his voice. I liked that he took <span class="class13">existentially fraught</span> free throws. I liked that he was a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin. And I liked that he had <span id="page_32"></span>two names. I’ve always liked people with two names, because you get to make up your mind what you call them: Gus or Augustus? Me, I was always just Hazel, univalent Hazel.</div>
<div class="class29">“Do you have siblings?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Huh?” he answered, seeming a little distracted.</div>
<div class="class29">“You said that thing about watching kids play.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Oh, yeah, no. I have nephews, from my half sisters. But they’re older. They’re like—DAD, HOW OLD ARE JULIE AND MARTHA?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Twenty-eight!”</div>
<div class="class29">“They’re like twenty-eight. They live in Chicago. They are both married to very fancy lawyer dudes. Or banker dudes. I can’t remember. You have siblings?”</div>
<div class="class29">I shook my head no. “So what’s your story?” he asked, sitting down next to me at a safe distance.</div>
<div class="class29">“I already told you my story. I was diagnosed when—”</div>
<div class="class29">“No, not your cancer story. <span class="class13">Your </span>story. Interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes, etcetera.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Um,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Don’t tell me you’re one of those people who becomes their disease. I know so many people like that. It’s disheartening. Like, cancer is in the growth business, right? The taking-people-over business. But surely you haven’t let it succeed prematurely.”</div>
<div class="class29">It occurred to me that perhaps I had. I struggled with how to pitch myself to Augustus Waters, which enthusiasms to embrace, and in the silence that followed it <span id="page_33"></span>occurred to me that I wasn’t very interesting. “I am pretty unextraordinary.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I reject that out of hand. Think of something you like. The first thing that comes to mind.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Um. Reading?”</div>
<div class="class29">“What do you read?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Everything. From, like, hideous romance to pretentious fiction to poetry. Whatever.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Do you write poetry, too?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No. I don’t write.”</div>
<div class="class29">“There!” Augustus almost shouted. “Hazel Grace, you are the only teenager in America who prefers reading poetry to writing it. This tells me so much. You read a lot of capital-G great books, don’t you?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I guess?”</div>
<div class="class29">“What’s your favorite?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Um,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">My favorite book, by a wide margin, was <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>, but I didn’t like to tell people about it. Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. And then there are books like <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>, which you can’t tell people about, books so special and rare and <span class="class13">yours</span> that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal.</div>
<div class="class29">It wasn’t even that the book was so good or anything; <span id="page_34"></span>it was just that the author, Peter Van Houten, seemed to understand me in weird and impossible ways. <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span> was <span class="class13">my</span> book, in the way my body was my body and my thoughts were my thoughts.</div>
<div class="class29">Even so, I told Augustus. “My favorite book is probably <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Does it feature zombies?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“No,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Stormtroopers?”</div>
<div class="class29">I shook my head. “It’s not that kind of book.”</div>
<div class="class29">He smiled. “I am going to read this terrible book with the boring title that does not contain stormtroopers,” he promised, and I immediately felt like I shouldn’t have told him about it. Augustus spun around to a stack of books beneath his bedside table. He grabbed a paperback and a pen. As he scribbled an inscription onto the title page, he said, “All I ask in exchange is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game.” He held up the book, which was called <span class="class13">The Price of Dawn</span>. I laughed and took it. Our hands kind of got muddled together in the book handoff, and then he was holding my hand. “Cold,” he said, pressing a finger to my pale wrist.</div>
<div class="class29">“Not cold so much as underoxygenated,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“I love it when you talk medical to me,” he said. He stood, and pulled me up with him, and did not let go of my hand until we reached the stairs<span id="page_35"></span>.</div>
<div class="class14">We watched the movie with several inches of couch between us. I did the totally middle-schooly thing wherein I put my hand on the couch about halfway between us to let him know that it was okay to hold it, but he didn’t try. An hour into the movie, Augustus’s parents came in and served us the enchiladas, which we ate on the couch, and they were pretty delicious.</div>
<div class="class29">The movie was about this heroic guy in a mask who died heroically for Natalie Portman, who’s pretty badass and very hot and does not have anything approaching my puffy steroid face.</div>
<div class="class29">As the credits rolled, he said, “Pretty great, huh?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Pretty great,” I agreed, although it wasn’t, really. It was kind of a boy movie. I don’t know why boys expect us to like boy movies. We don’t expect them to like girl movies. “I should get home. Class in the morning,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">I sat on the couch for a while as Augustus searched for his keys. His mom sat down next to me and said, “I just love this one, don’t you?” I guess I had been looking toward the Encouragement above the TV, a drawing of an angel with the caption <span class="class13">Without Pain, How Could We Know Joy?</span></div>
<div class="class29">(This is an old argument in the field of Thinking About Suffering, and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries, but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not in any way affect the taste of chocolate.) “Yes,” I said. “A lovely thought.”</div>
<div class="class29">I drove Augustus’s car home with Augustus riding <span id="page_36"></span>shotgun. He played me a couple songs he liked by a band called The Hectic Glow, and they were good songs, but because I didn’t know them already, they weren’t as good to me as they were to him. I kept glancing over at his leg, or the place where his leg had been, trying to imagine what the fake leg looked like. I didn’t want to care about it, but I did a little. He probably cared about my oxygen. Illness repulses. I’d learned that a long time ago, and I suspected Augustus had, too.</div>
<div class="class29">As I pulled up outside of my house, Augustus clicked the radio off. The air thickened. He was probably thinking about kissing me, and I was definitely thinking about kissing him. Wondering if I wanted to. I’d kissed boys, but it had been a while. Pre-Miracle.</div>
<div class="class29">I put the car in park and looked over at him. He really was beautiful. I know boys aren’t supposed to be, but he was.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel Grace,” he said, my name new and better in his voice. “It has been a real pleasure to make your acquaintance.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Ditto, Mr. Waters,” I said. I felt shy looking at him. I could not match the intensity of his waterblue eyes.</div>
<div class="class29">“May I see you again?” he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.</div>
<div class="class29">I smiled. “Sure.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Tomorrow?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Patience, grasshopper,” I counseled. “You don’t want to seem overeager.<span id="page_37"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“Right, that’s why I said tomorrow,” he said. “I want to see you again tonight. But I’m willing to wait <span class="class13">all night and much of tomorrow</span>.” I rolled my eyes. “I’m <span class="class13">serious</span>,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“You don’t even know me,” I said. I grabbed the book from the center console. “How about I call you when I finish this?”</div>
<div class="class29">“But you don’t even have my phone number,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“I strongly suspect you wrote it in the book.”</div>
<div class="class29">He broke out into that goofy smile. “And you say we don’t know each other.”</div>
