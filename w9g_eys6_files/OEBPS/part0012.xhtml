<div class="class28">Chapter Four</div>
<div class="calibre1">I went to bed a little early that night, changing into boy boxers and a T-shirt before crawling under the covers of my bed, which was queen size and pillow topped and one of my favorite places in the world. And then I started reading <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span> for the millionth time.</div>
<div class="class29"><span class="class13">AIA</span> is about this girl named Anna (who narrates the story) and her one-eyed mom, who is a professional gardener obsessed with tulips, and they have a normal lower-middle- class life in a little central California town until Anna gets this rare blood cancer.</div>
<div class="class29">But it’s not a <span class="class13">cancer book</span>, because cancer books suck. Like, in cancer books, the cancer person starts a charity that <span id="page_49"></span>raises money to fight cancer, right? And this commitment to charity reminds the cancer person of the essential goodness of humanity and makes him/her feel loved and encouraged because s/he will leave a cancer-curing legacy. But in <span class="class13">AIA</span>, Anna decides that being a person with cancer who starts a cancer charity is a bit narcissistic, so she starts a charity called The Anna Foundation for People with Cancer Who Want to Cure Cholera.</div>
<div class="class29">Also, Anna is honest about all of it in a way no one else really is: Throughout the book, she refers to herself as <span class="class13">the side effect</span>, which is just totally correct. Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that made the diversity of life on earth possible. So as the story goes on, she gets sicker, the treatments and disease racing to kill her, and her mom falls in love with this Dutch tulip trader Anna calls the Dutch Tulip Man. The Dutch Tulip Man has lots of money and very eccentric ideas about how to treat cancer, but Anna thinks this guy might be a con man and possibly not even Dutch, and then just as the possibly Dutch guy and her mom are about to get married and Anna is about to start this crazy new treatment regimen involving wheatgrass and low doses of arsenic, the book ends right in the middle of a</div>
<div class="class29">I know it’s a very <span class="class13">literary</span> decision and everything and probably part of the reason I love the book so much, but there is something to recommend a story that <span class="class13">ends</span>. And if <span id="page_50"></span>it can’t end, then it should at least continue into perpetuity like the adventures of Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem’s platoon.</div>
<div class="class29">I understood the story ended because Anna died or got too sick to write and this midsentence thing was supposed to reflect how life really ends and whatever, but there were characters other than Anna in the story, and it seemed unfair that I would never find out what happened to them. I’d written, care of his publisher, a dozen letters to Peter Van Houten, each asking for some answers about what happens after the end of the story: whether the Dutch Tulip Man is a con man, whether Anna’s mother ends up married to him, what happens to Anna’s stupid hamster (which her mom hates), whether Anna’s friends graduate from high school—all that stuff. But he’d never responded to any of my letters.</div>
<div class="class29"><span class="class13">AIA</span> was the only book Peter Van Houten had written, and all anyone seemed to know about him was that after the book came out he moved from the United States to the Netherlands and became kind of reclusive. I imagined that he was working on a sequel set in the Netherlands—maybe Anna’s mom and the Dutch Tulip Man end up moving there and trying to start a new life. But it had been ten years since <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span> came out, and Van Houten hadn’t published so much as a blog post. I couldn’t wait forever.</div>
<div class="class29">As I reread that night, I kept getting distracted imagining Augustus Waters reading the same words. I wondered if he’d like it, or if he’d dismiss it as pretentious. <span id="page_51"></span>Then I remembered my promise to call him after reading <span class="class13">The Price of Dawn</span>, so I found his number on its title page and texted him.</div>
<div class="class30">Price of Dawn review: Too many bodies. Not enough adjectives. How’s AIA?</div>
<div class="calibre1">He replied a minute later:</div>
<div class="class30">As I recall, you promised to CALL when you finished the book, not text.</div>
<div class="calibre1">So I called.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel Grace,” he said upon picking up.</div>
<div class="class29">“So have you read it?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, I haven’t finished it. It’s six hundred fifty-one pages long and I’ve had twenty-four hours.”</div>
<div class="class29">“How far are you?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Four fifty-three.”</div>
<div class="class29">“And?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I will withhold judgment until I finish. However, I will say that I’m feeling a bit embarrassed to have given you <span class="class13">The Price of Dawn</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Don’t be. I’m already on<span class="class13"> Requiem for Mayhem</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">“A sparkling addition to the series. So, okay, is the tulip guy a crook? I’m getting a bad vibe from him.”</div>
<div class="class29">“No spoilers,” I said<span id="page_52"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">“If he is anything other than a total gentleman, I’m going to gouge his eyes out.”</div>
<div class="class29">“So you’re into it.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Withholding judgment! When can I see you?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Certainly not until you finish <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>.” I enjoyed being coy.</div>
<div class="class29">“Then I’d better hang up and start reading.”</div>
<div class="class29">“You’d better,” I said, and the line clicked dead without another word.</div>
<div class="class29">Flirting was new to me, but I liked it.</div>
<div class="class14">The next morning I had Twentieth-Century American Poetry at MCC. This old woman gave a lecture wherein she managed to talk for ninety minutes about Sylvia Plath without ever once quoting a single word of Sylvia Plath.</div>
<div class="class29">When I got out of class, Mom was idling at the curb in front of the building.</div>
<div class="class29">“Did you just wait here the entire time?” I asked as she hurried around to help me haul my cart and tank into the car.</div>
<div class="class29">“No, I picked up the dry cleaning and went to the post office.”</div>
<div class="class29">“And then?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I have a book to read,” she said.</div>
<div class="class29">“And <span class="class13">I’m</span> the one who needs to get a life.” I smiled, and she tried to smile back, but there was something flimsy in it. <span id="page_53"></span>After a second, I said, “Wanna go to a movie?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Sure. Anything you’ve been wanting to see?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Let’s just do the thing where we go and see whatever starts next.” She closed the door for me and walked around to the driver’s side. We drove over to the Castleton theater and watched a 3-D movie about talking gerbils. It was kind of funny, actually.</div>
<div class="class14">When I got out of the movie, I had four text messages from Augustus.</div>
<div class="class31">Tell me my copy is missing the last twenty pages or something.</div>
<div class="class32">Hazel Grace, tell me I have not reached the end of this book.</div>
<div class="class32">OH MY GOD DO THEY GET MARRIED OR NOT OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS</div>
<div class="class33">I guess Anna died and so it just ends? CRUEL. Call me when you can. Hope all’s okay.</div>
<div class="calibre1">So when I got home I went out into the backyard and sat down on this rusting latticed patio chair and called him. It was a cloudy day, typical Indiana: the kind of weather <span id="page_54"></span>that boxes you in. Our little backyard was dominated by my childhood swing set, which was looking pretty waterlogged and pathetic.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus picked up on the third ring. “Hazel Grace,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“So welcome to the sweet torture of reading <span class="class13">An Imperial</span>—” I stopped when I heard violent sobbing on the other end of the line. “Are you okay?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“I’m grand,” Augustus answered. “I am, however, with Isaac, who seems to be decompensating.” More wailing. Like the death cries of some injured animal. Gus turned his attention to Isaac. “Dude. Dude. Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse? Isaac. Focus. On. Me.” After a minute, Gus said to me, “Can you meet us at my house in, say, twenty minutes?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Sure,” I said, and hung up.</div>
<div class="class14">If you could drive in a straight line, it would only take like five minutes to get from my house to Augustus’s house, but you can’t drive in a straight line because Holliday Park is between us.</div>
<div class="class29">Even though it was a geographic inconvenience, I really liked Holliday Park. When I was a little kid, I would wade in the White River with my dad and there was always this great moment when he would throw me up in the air, just toss me away from him, and I would reach out my arms as I flew and he would reach out his arms, and then we would both <span id="page_55"></span>see that our arms were not going to touch and no one was going to catch me, and it would kind of scare the shit out of both of us in the best possible way, and then I would legs-flailingly hit the water and then come up for air uninjured and the current would bring me back to him as I said <span class="class13">again, Daddy, again</span>.</div>
<div class="class29">I pulled into the driveway right next to an old black Toyota sedan I figured was Isaac’s car. Carting the tank behind me, I walked up to the door. I knocked. Gus’s dad answered.</div>
<div class="class29">“Just Hazel,” he said. “Nice to see you.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Augustus said I could come over?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah, he and Isaac are in the basement.” At which point there was a wail from below. “That would be Isaac,” Gus’s dad said, and shook his head slowly. “Cindy had to go for a drive. The sound…” he said, drifting off. “Anyway, I guess you’re wanted downstairs. Can I carry your, uh, tank?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Nah, I’m good. Thanks, though, Mr. Waters.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Mark,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">I was kind of scared to go down there. Listening to people howl in misery is not among my favorite pastimes. But I went.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel Grace,” Augustus said as he heard my footsteps. “Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs. Hazel, a gentle reminder: Isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode.”</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus and Isaac were sitting on the floor in gaming <span id="page_56"></span>chairs shaped like lazy <span class="class13">L</span>s, staring up at a gargantuan television. The screen was split between Isaac’s point of view on the left, and Augustus’s on the right. They were soldiers fighting in a bombed-out modern city. I recognized the place from <span class="class13">The Price of Dawn</span>. As I approached, I saw nothing unusual: just two guys sitting in the lightwash of a huge television pretending to kill people.</div>
<div class="class29">Only when I got parallel to them did I see Isaac’s face. Tears streamed down his reddened cheeks in a continual flow, his face a taut mask of pain. He stared at the screen, not even glancing at me, and howled, all the while pounding away at his controller. “How are you, Hazel?” asked Augustus.</div>
<div class="class29">“I’m okay,” I said. “Isaac?” No response. Not even the slightest hint that he was aware of my existence. Just the tears flowing down his face onto his black T-shirt.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus glanced away from the screen ever so briefly. “You look nice,” he said. I was wearing this just-past-the-knees dress I’d had forever. “Girls think they’re only allowed to wear dresses on formal occasions, but I like a woman who says, you know, <span class="class13">I’m going over to see a boy who is having a nervous breakdown, a boy whose connection to the sense of sight itself is tenuous, and gosh dang it, I am going to wear a dress for him</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">“And yet,” I said, “Isaac won’t so much as glance over at me. Too in love with Monica, I suppose,” which resulted in a catastrophic sob.</div>
<div class="class29">“Bit of a touchy subject,” Augustus explained. “Isaac, <span id="page_57"></span>I don’t know about you, but I have the vague sense that we are being outflanked.” And then back to me, “Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern, but he doesn’t want to talk about it. He just wants to cry and play Counterinsurgence 2: The Price of Dawn.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Fair enough,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Isaac, I feel a growing concern about our position. If you agree, head over to that power station, and I’ll cover you.” Isaac ran toward a nondescript building while Augustus fired a machine gun wildly in a series of quick bursts, running behind him.</div>
<div class="class29">“Anyway,” Augustus said to me, “it doesn’t hurt to <span class="class13">talk</span> to him. If you have any sage words of feminine advice.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I actually think his response is probably appropriate,” I said as a burst of gunfire from Isaac killed an enemy who’d peeked his head out from behind the burned-out husk of a pickup truck.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus nodded at the screen. “Pain demands to be felt,” he said, which was a line from <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>. “You’re sure there’s no one behind us?” he asked Isaac. Moments later, tracer bullets started whizzing over their heads. “Oh, goddamn it, Isaac,” Augustus said. “I don’t mean to criticize you in your moment of great weakness, but you’ve allowed us to be outflanked, and now there’s nothing between the terrorists and the school.” Isaac’s character took off running toward the fire, zigging and zagging down a narrow alleyway<span id="page_58"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">“You could go over the bridge and circle back,” I said, a tactic I knew about thanks to <span class="class13">The Price of Dawn</span>.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus sighed. “Sadly, the bridge is already under insurgent control due to questionable strategizing by my bereft cohort.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Me?” Isaac said, his voice breathy. “Me?! You’re the one who suggested we hole up in the freaking power station.”</div>
<div class="class29">Gus turned away from the screen for a second and flashed his crooked smile at Isaac. “I knew you could talk, buddy,” he said. “Now let’s go save some fictional schoolchildren.”</div>
<div class="class29">Together, they ran down the alleyway, firing and hiding at the right moments, until they reached this one-story, single-room schoolhouse. They crouched behind a wall across the street and picked off the enemy one by one.</div>
<div class="class29">“Why do they want to get into the school?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“They want the kids as hostages,” Augustus answered. His shoulders rounded over his controller, slamming buttons, his forearms taut, veins visible. Isaac leaned toward the screen, the controller dancing in his thin-fingered hands. “Get it get it get it,” Augustus said. The waves of terrorists continued, and they mowed down every one, their shooting astonishingly precise, as it had to be, lest they fire into the school.</div>
<div class="class29">“Grenade! Grenade!” Augustus shouted as something <span id="page_59"></span>arced across the screen, bounced in the doorway of the school, and then rolled against the door.</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac dropped his controller in disappointment. “If the bastards can’t take hostages, they just kill them and claim we did it.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Cover me!” Augustus said as he jumped out from behind the wall and raced toward the school. Isaac fumbled for his controller and then started firing while the bullets rained down on Augustus, who was shot once and then twice but still ran, Augustus shouting, <span class="class13">“YOU CAN’T KILL MAX MAYHEM!”</span> and with a final flurry of button combinations, he dove onto the grenade, which detonated beneath him. His dismembered body exploded like a geyser and the screen went red. A throaty voice said, “MISSION FAILURE,” but Augustus seemed to think otherwise as he smiled at his remnants on the screen. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a cigarette, and shoved it between his teeth. “Saved the kids,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Temporarily,” I pointed out.</div>
<div class="class29">“All salvation is temporary,” Augustus shot back. “I bought them a minute. Maybe that’s the minute that buys them an hour, which is the hour that buys them a year. No one’s gonna buy them forever, Hazel Grace, but my life bought them a minute. And that’s not nothing.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Whoa, okay,” I said. “We’re just talking about pixels.”</div>
<div class="class29">He shrugged, as if he believed the game might be really <span id="page_60"></span>real. Isaac was wailing again. Augustus snapped his head back to him. “Another go at the mission, corporal?”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac shook his head no. He leaned over Augustus to look at me and through tightly strung vocal cords said, “She didn’t want to do it after.”</div>
<div class="class29">“She didn’t want to dump a blind guy,” I said. He nodded, the tears not like tears so much as a quiet metronome—steady, endless.</div>
<div class="class29">“She said she couldn’t handle it,” he told me. “I’m about to lose my eyesight and <span class="class13">she</span> can’t handle it.”</div>
<div class="class29">I was thinking about the word <span class="class13">handle</span>, and all the unholdable things that get handled. “I’m sorry,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">He wiped his sopping face with a sleeve. Behind his glasses, Isaac’s eyes seemed so big that everything else on his face kind of disappeared and it was just these disembodied floating eyes staring at me—one real, one glass. “It’s unacceptable,” he told me. “It’s totally unacceptable.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, to be fair,” I said, “I mean, she probably <span class="class13">can’t</span> handle it. Neither can you, but she doesn’t <span class="class13">have </span>to handle it. And you do.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I kept saying ‘always’ to her today, ‘always always always,’ and she just kept talking over me and not saying it back. It was like I was already gone, you know? ‘Always’ was a promise! How can you just break the promise?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Sometimes people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them,” I said<span id="page_61"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac shot me a look. “Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That’s what love<span class="class13"> is</span>. Love is keeping the promise anyway. Don’t you believe in true love?”</div>
<div class="class29">I didn’t answer. I didn’t have an answer. But I thought that if true love <span class="class13">did</span> exist, that was a pretty good definition of it.</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, I believe in true love,” Isaac said. “And I love her. And she promised. She <span class="class13">promised me always</span>.” He stood and took a step toward me. I pushed myself up, thinking he wanted a hug or something, but then he just spun around, like he couldn’t remember why he’d stood up in the first place, and then Augustus and I both saw this rage settle into his face.</div>
<div class="class29">“Isaac,” Gus said.</div>
<div class="class29">“What?”</div>
<div class="class29">“You look a little… Pardon the double entendre, my friend, but there’s something a little worrisome in your eyes.”</div>
<div class="class29">Suddenly Isaac started kicking the crap out of his gaming chair, which somersaulted back toward Gus’s bed. “Here we go,” said Augustus. Isaac chased after the chair and kicked it again. “Yes,” Augustus said. “Get it. Kick the shit out of that chair!” Isaac kicked the chair again, until it bounced against Gus’s bed, and then he grabbed one of the pillows and started slamming it against the wall between the bed and the trophy shelf above<span id="page_62"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus looked over at me, cigarette still in his mouth, and half smiled. “I can’t stop thinking about that book.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I know, right?”</div>
<div class="class29">“He never said what happens to the other characters?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No,” I told him. Isaac was still throttling the wall with the pillow. “He moved to Amsterdam, which makes me think maybe he is writing a sequel featuring the Dutch Tulip Man, but he hasn’t published anything. He’s never interviewed. He doesn’t seem to be online. I’ve written him a bunch of letters asking what happens to everyone, but he never responds. So… yeah.” I stopped talking because Augustus didn’t appear to be listening. Instead, he was squinting at Isaac.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hold on,” he mumbled to me. He walked over to Isaac and grabbed him by the shoulders. “Dude, pillows don’t break. Try something that breaks.”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac reached for a basketball trophy from the shelf above the bed and then held it over his head as if waiting for permission. “Yes,” Augustus said. “Yes!” The trophy smashed against the floor, the plastic basketball player’s arm splintering off, still grasping its ball. Isaac stomped on the trophy. “Yes!” Augustus said. “Get it!”</div>
<div class="class29">And then back to me, “I’ve been looking for a way to tell my father that I actually sort of hate basketball, and I think we’ve found it.” The trophies came down one after the other, and Isaac stomped on them and screamed while Augustus <span id="page_63"></span>and I stood a few feet away, bearing witness to the madness. The poor, mangled bodies of plastic basketballers littered the carpeted ground: here, a ball palmed by a disembodied hand; there, two torsoless legs caught midjump. Isaac kept attacking the trophies, jumping on them with both feet, screaming, breathless, sweaty, until finally he collapsed on top of the jagged trophic remnants.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus stepped toward him and looked down. “Feel better?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“No,” Isaac mumbled, his chest heaving.</div>
<div class="class29">“That’s the thing about pain,” Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. “It demands to be felt.”</div>
