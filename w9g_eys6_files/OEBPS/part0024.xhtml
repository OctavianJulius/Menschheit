<div class="class28">Chapter Sixteen</div>
<div class="calibre1">A typical day with late-stage Gus:</div>
<div class="class29">I went over to his house about noon, after he had eaten and puked up breakfast. He met me at the door in his wheelchair, no longer the muscular, gorgeous boy who stared at me at Support Group, but still half smiling, still smoking his unlit cigarette, his blue eyes bright and alive.</div>
<div class="class29">We ate lunch with his parents at the dining room table. Peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and last night’s asparagus. Gus didn’t eat. I asked how he was feeling.</div>
<div class="class29">“Grand,” he said. “And you?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Good. What’d you do last night?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I slept quite a lot. I want to write you a sequel, Hazel Grace, but I’m just so damned tired all the time.<span id="page_235"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“You can just tell it to me,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, I stand by my pre–Van Houten analysis of the Dutch Tulip Man. Not a con man, but not as rich as he was letting on.”</div>
<div class="class29">“And what about Anna’s mom?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Haven’t settled on an opinion there. Patience, Grasshopper.” Augustus smiled. His parents were quiet, watching him, never looking away, like they just wanted to enjoy The Gus Waters Show while it was still in town. “Sometimes I dream that I’m writing a memoir. A memoir would be just the thing to keep me in the hearts and memories of my adoring public.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Why do you need an adoring public when you’ve got me?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel Grace, when you’re as charming and physically attractive as myself, it’s easy enough to win over people you meet. But getting strangers to love you… now, <span class="class13">that’s</span> the trick.”</div>
<div class="class29">I rolled my eyes.</div>
<div class="class14">After lunch, we went outside to the backyard. He was still well enough to push his own wheelchair, pulling miniature wheelies to get the front wheels over the bump in the doorway. Still athletic, in spite of it all, blessed with balance and quick reflexes that even the abundant narcotics could not fully mask.</div>
<div class="class29">His parents stayed inside, but when I glanced back into the dining room, they were always watching us<span id="page_236"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">We sat out there in silence for a minute and then Gus said, “I wish we had that swing set sometimes.”</div>
<div class="class29">“The one from my backyard?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah. My nostalgia is so extreme that I am capable of missing a swing my butt never actually touched.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Nostalgia is a side effect of cancer,” I told him.</div>
<div class="class29">“Nah, nostalgia is a side effect of dying,” he answered. Above us, the wind blew and the branching shadows rearranged themselves on our skin. Gus squeezed my hand. “It is a good life, Hazel Grace.”</div>
<div class="class14">We went inside when he needed meds, which were pressed into him along with liquid nutrition through his G-tube, a bit of plastic that disappeared into his belly. He was quiet for a while, zoned out. His mom wanted him to take a nap, but he kept shaking his head no when she suggested it, so we just let him sit there half asleep in the chair for a while.</div>
<div class="class29">His parents watched an old video of Gus with his sisters—they were probably my age and Gus was about five. They were playing basketball in the driveway of a different house, and even though Gus was tiny, he could dribble like he’d been born doing it, running circles around his sisters as they laughed. It was the first time I’d even seen him play basketball. “He was good,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Should’ve seen him in high school,” his dad said. “Started varsity as a freshman.”</div>
<div class="class29">Gus mumbled, “Can I go downstairs?<span id="page_237"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">His mom and dad wheeled the chair downstairs with Gus still in it, bouncing down crazily in a way that would have been dangerous if danger retained its relevance, and then they left us alone. He got into bed and we lay there together under the covers, me on my side and Gus on his back, my head on his bony shoulder, his heat radiating through his polo shirt and into my skin, my feet tangled with his real foot, my hand on his cheek.</div>
<div class="class29">When I got his face nose-touchingly close so that I could only see his eyes, I couldn’t tell he was sick. We kissed for a while and then lay together listening to The Hectic Glow’s eponymous album, and eventually we fell asleep like that, a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies.</div>
<div class="class14">We woke up later and arranged an armada of pillows so that we could sit comfortably against the edge of the bed and played Counterinsurgence 2: The Price of Dawn. I sucked at it, of course, but my sucking was useful to him: It made it easier for him to die beautifully, to jump in front of a sniper’s bullet and sacrifice himself for me, or else to kill a sentry who was just about to shoot me. How he reveled in saving me. He shouted, “You will <span class="class13">not</span> kill my girlfriend today, International Terrorist of Ambiguous Nationality!”</div>
<div class="class29">It crossed my mind to fake a choking incident or something so that he might give me the Heimlich. Maybe then he could rid himself of this fear that his life had been lived and lost for no greater good. But then I imagined <span id="page_238"></span>him being physically unable to Heimlich, and me having to reveal that it was all a ruse, and the ensuing mutual humiliation.</div>
<div class="class29">It’s hard as hell to hold on to your dignity when the risen sun is too bright in your losing eyes, and that’s what I was thinking about as we hunted for bad guys through the ruins of a city that didn’t exist.</div>
<div class="class29">Finally, his dad came down and dragged Gus back upstairs, and in the entryway, beneath an Encouragement telling me that Friends Are Forever, I knelt to kiss him good night. I went home and ate dinner with my parents, leaving Gus to eat (and puke up) his own dinner.</div>
<div class="class29">After some TV, I went to sleep.</div>
<div class="class29">I woke up.</div>
<div class="class29">Around noon, I went over there again.</div>
