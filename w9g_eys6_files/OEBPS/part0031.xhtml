<div class="class28">Chapter Twenty-Three</div>
<div class="calibre1">A couple days later, I got up around noon and drove over to Isaac’s house. He answered the door himself. “My mom took Graham to a movie,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“We should go do something,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Can the something be play blind-guy video games while sitting on the couch?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah, that’s just the kind of something I had in mind.”</div>
<div class="class29">So we sat there for a couple hours talking to the screen together, navigating this invisible labyrinthine cave without a single lumen of light. The most entertaining part of the game by far was trying to get the computer to engage us in humorous conversation<span id="page_280"></span>:</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Touch the cave wall.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You touch the cave wall. It is moist.”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac: “Lick the cave wall.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “I do not understand. Repeat?”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Hump the moist cave wall.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You attempt to jump. You hit your head.”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac: “Not<span class="class13"> jump. HUMP</span>.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “I don’t understand.”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac: “Dude, I’ve been alone in the dark in this cave for weeks and I need some relief. HUMP THE CAVE WALL.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You attempt to ju—”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Thrust pelvis against the cave wall.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “I do not—”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac: “Make sweet love to the cave.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “I do not—”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “<span class="class13">FINE.</span> Follow left branch.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You follow the left branch. The passage narrows.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Crawl.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You crawl for one hundred yards. The passage narrows.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Snake crawl.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You snake crawl for thirty yards. A trickle of water runs down your body. You reach a mound of small rocks blocking the passageway.”</div>
<div class="class29">Me: “Can I hump the cave now?”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “You cannot jump without standing.<span id="page_281"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac: “I dislike living in a world without Augustus Waters.”</div>
<div class="class29">Computer: “I don’t understand—”</div>
<div class="class29">Isaac: “Me neither. Pause.”</div>
<div class="class14">He dropped the remote onto the couch between us and asked, “Do you know if it hurt or whatever?”</div>
<div class="class29">“He was really fighting for breath, I guess,” I said. “He eventually went unconscious, but it sounds like, yeah, it wasn’t great or anything. Dying sucks.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” Isaac said. And then after a long time, “It just seems so impossible.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Happens all the time,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“You seem angry,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” I said. We just sat there quiet for a long time, which was fine, and I was thinking about way back in the very beginning in the Literal Heart of Jesus when Gus told us that he feared oblivion, and I told him that he was fearing something universal and inevitable, and how really, the problem is not suffering itself or oblivion itself but the depraved meaninglessness of these things, the absolutely<span class="class13"> </span>inhuman nihilism of suffering. I thought of my dad telling me that the universe wants to be noticed. But what we want is to be noticed by the universe, to have the universe give a shit what happens to us—not the collective idea of sentient life but each of us, as individuals.</div>
<div class="class29">“Gus really loved you, you know,” he said<span id="page_282"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">“I know.”</div>
<div class="class29">“He wouldn’t shut up about it.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I know,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“It was annoying.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I didn’t find it that annoying,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Did he ever give you that thing he was writing?”</div>
<div class="class29">“What thing?”</div>
<div class="class29">“That sequel or whatever to that book you liked.”</div>
<div class="class29">I turned to Isaac. “What?”</div>
<div class="class29">“He said he was working on something for you but he wasn’t that good of a writer.”</div>
<div class="class29">“When did he say this?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I don’t know. Like, after he got back from Amsterdam at some point.”</div>
<div class="class29">“At which point?” I pressed. Had he not had a chance to finish it? Had he finished it and left it on his computer or something?</div>
<div class="class29">“Um,” Isaac sighed. “Um, I don’t know. We talked about it over here once. He was over here, like—uh, we played with my email machine and I’d just gotten an email from my grandmother. I can check on the machine if you—”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah, yeah, where is it?”</div>
<div class="class14">He’d mentioned it a month before. A month. Not a good month, admittedly, but still—a month. That was enough time for him to have written<span class="class13"> something</span>, at least. There was <span id="page_283"></span>still something of him, or by him at least, floating around out there. I needed it.</div>
<div class="class29">“I’m gonna go to his house,” I told Isaac.</div>
<div class="class29">I hurried out to the minivan and hauled the oxygen cart up and into the passenger seat. I started the car. A hip-hop beat blared from the stereo, and as I reached to change the radio station, someone started rapping. In Swedish.</div>
<div class="class29">I swiveled around and screamed when I saw Peter Van Houten sitting in the backseat.</div>
<div class="class29">“I apologize for alarming you,” Peter Van Houten said over the rapping. He was still wearing the funeral suit, almost a week later. He smelled like he was sweating alcohol. “You’re welcome to keep the CD,” he said. “It’s Snook, one of the major Swedish—”</div>
<div class="class29">“Ah ah ah ah GET OUT OF MY CAR.” I turned off the stereo.</div>
<div class="class29">“It’s your mother’s car, as I understand it,” he said. “Also, it wasn’t locked.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Oh, my God! Get out of the car or I’ll call nine-one-one. Dude, what is your <span class="class13">problem</span>?”</div>
<div class="class29">“If only there were just one,” he mused. “I am here simply to apologize. You were correct in noting earlier that I am a pathetic little man, dependent upon alcohol. I had one acquaintance who only spent time with me because I paid her to do so—worse, still, she has since quit, leaving me the rare soul who cannot acquire companionship even <span id="page_284"></span>through bribery. It is all true, Hazel. All that and more.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Okay,” I said. It would have been a more moving speech had he not slurred his words.</div>
<div class="class29">“You remind me of Anna.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I remind a lot of people of a lot of people,” I answered. “I really have to go.”</div>
<div class="class29">“So drive,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Get out.”</div>
<div class="class29">“No. You remind me of Anna,” he said again. After a second, I put the car in reverse and backed out. I couldn’t make him leave, and I didn’t have to. I’d drive to Gus’s house, and Gus’s parents would make him leave.</div>
<div class="class29">“You are, of course, familiar,” Van Houten said, “with Antonietta Meo.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah, no,” I said. I turned on the stereo, and the Swedish hip-hop blared, but Van Houten yelled over it.</div>
<div class="class29">“She may soon be the youngest nonmartyr saint ever beatified by the Catholic Church. She had the same cancer that Mr. Waters had, osteosarcoma. They removed her right leg. The pain was excruciating. As Antonietta Meo lay dying at the ripened age of six from this agonizing cancer, she told her father, ‘Pain is like fabric: The stronger it is, the more it’s worth.’ Is that true, Hazel?”</div>
<div class="class29">I wasn’t looking at him directly but at his reflection in the mirror. “No,” I shouted over the music. “That’s bullshit.<span id="page_285"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“But don’t you wish it were true!” he cried back. I cut the music. “I’m sorry I ruined your trip. You were too young. You were—” He broke down. As if he had a right to cry over Gus. Van Houten was just another of the endless mourners who did not know him, another too-late lamentation on his wall.</div>
<div class="class29">“You didn’t ruin our trip, you self-important bastard. We had an awesome trip.”</div>
<div class="class29"><span class="class13">“I am trying,”</span> he said. <span class="class13">“I am trying, I swear.”</span> It was around then that I realized Peter Van Houten had a dead person in his family. I considered the honesty with which he had written about cancer kids; the fact that he couldn’t speak to me in Amsterdam except to ask if I’d dressed like her on purpose; his shittiness around me and Augustus; his aching question about the relationship between pain’s extremity and its value. He sat back there drinking, an old man who’d been drunk for years. I thought of a statistic I wish I didn’t know: Half of marriages end in the year after a child’s death. I looked back at Van Houten. I was driving down College and I pulled over behind a line of parked cars and asked, “You had a kid who died?”</div>
<div class="class29">“My daughter,” he said. “She was eight. Suffered beautifully. Will never be beatified.”</div>
<div class="class29">“She had leukemia?” I asked. He nodded. “Like Anna,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Very much like her, yes.<span id="page_286"></span>”</div>
<div class="class29">“You were married?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No. Well, not at the time of her death. I was insufferable long before we lost her. Grief does not change you, Hazel. It reveals you.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Did you live with her?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No, not primarily, although at the end, we brought her to New York, where I was living, for a series of experimental tortures that increased the misery of her days without increasing the number of them.”</div>
<div class="class29">After a second, I said, “So it’s like you gave her this second life where she got to be a teenager.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I suppose that would be a fair assessment,” he said, and then quickly added, “I assume you are familiar with Philippa Foot’s Trolley Problem thought experiment?”</div>
<div class="class29">“And then I show up at your house and I’m dressed like the girl you hoped she would live to become and you’re, like, all taken aback by it.”</div>
<div class="class29">“There’s a trolley running out of control down a track,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“I don’t care about your stupid thought experiment,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“It’s Philippa Foot’s, actually.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, hers either,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“She didn’t understand why it was happening,” he said. “I had to tell her she would die. Her social worker said I had to tell her. I had to tell her she would die, so I told her she was going to heaven. She asked if I would be there, and <span id="page_287"></span>I said that I would not, not yet. But eventually, she said, and I promised that yes, of course, very soon. And I told her that in the meantime we had great family up there that would take care of her. And she asked me when I would be there, and I told her soon. Twenty-two years ago.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I’m sorry.”</div>
<div class="class29">“So am I.”</div>
<div class="class29">After a while, I asked, “What happened to her mom?”</div>
<div class="class29">He smiled. “You’re still looking for your sequel, you little rat.”</div>
<div class="class29">I smiled back. “You should go home,” I told him. “Sober up. Write another novel. Do the thing you’re good at. Not many people are lucky enough to be so good at something.”</div>
<div class="class29">He stared at me through the mirror for a long time. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah. You’re right. You’re right.” But even as he said it, he pulled out his mostly empty fifth of whiskey. He drank, recapped the bottle, and opened the door. “Good-bye, Hazel.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Take it easy, Van Houten.”</div>
<div class="class29">He sat down on the curb behind the car. As I watched him shrink in the rearview mirror, he pulled out the bottle and for a second it looked like he would leave it on the curb. And then he took a swig.</div>
<div class="class14">It was a hot afternoon in Indianapolis, the air thick and still like we were inside a cloud. It was the worst kind of air for me, and I told myself it was just the air when the walk <span id="page_288"></span>from his driveway to his front door felt infinite. I rang the doorbell, and Gus’s mom answered.</div>
<div class="class29">“Oh, Hazel,” she said, and kind of enveloped me, crying.</div>
<div class="class29">She made me eat some eggplant lasagna—I guess a lot of people had brought them food or whatever—with her and Gus’s dad. “How are you?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I miss him.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah.”</div>
<div class="class29">I didn’t really know what to say. I just wanted to go downstairs and find whatever he’d written for me. Plus, the silence in the room really bothered me. I wanted them to be talking to each other, comforting or holding hands or whatever. But they just sat there eating very small amounts of lasagna, not even looking at each other. “Heaven needed an angel,” his dad said after a while.</div>
<div class="class29">“I know,” I said. Then his sisters and their mess of kids showed up and piled into the kitchen. I got up and hugged both his sisters and then watched the kids run around the kitchen with their sorely needed surplus of noise and movement, excited molecules bouncing against each other and shouting, “You’re it no you’re it no I was it but then I tagged you you didn’t tag me you missed me well I’m tagging you now no dumb butt it’s a time-out DANIEL DO NOT CALL YOUR BROTHER A DUMB BUTT Mom if I’m not allowed to use that word how come you just used it <span id="page_289"></span>dumb butt dumb butt,” and then, chorally, <span class="class13">dumb butt dumb butt dumb butt dumb butt</span>, and at the table Gus’s parents were now holding hands, which made me feel better.</div>
<div class="class29">“Isaac told me Gus was writing something, something for me,” I said. The kids were still singing their dumb-butt song.</div>
<div class="class29">“We can check his computer,” his mom said.</div>
<div class="class29">“He wasn’t on it much the last few weeks,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“That’s true. I’m not even sure we brought it upstairs. Is it still in the basement, Mark?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No idea.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Well,” I said, “can I…” I nodded toward the basement door.</div>
<div class="class29">“We’re not ready,” his dad said. “But of course, yes, Hazel. Of course you can.”</div>
<div class="class14">I walked downstairs, past his unmade bed, past the gaming chairs beneath the TV. His computer was still on. I tapped the mouse to wake it up and then searched for his most recently edited files. Nothing in the last month. The most recent thing was a response paper to Toni Morrison’s <span class="class13">The Bluest Eye</span>.</div>
<div class="class29">Maybe he’d written something by hand. I walked over to his bookshelves, looking for a journal or a notebook. Nothing. I flipped through his copy of <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span>. He hadn’t left a single mark in it<span id="page_290"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">I walked to his bedside table next. <span class="class13">Infinite Mayhem</span>, the ninth sequel to <span class="class13">The Price of Dawn</span>, lay atop the table next to his reading lamp, the corner of page 138 turned down. He’d never made it to the end of the book. “Spoiler alert: Mayhem survives,” I said out loud to him, just in case he could hear me.</div>
<div class="class29">And then I crawled into his unmade bed, wrapping myself in his comforter like a cocoon, surrounding myself with his smell. I took out my cannula so I could smell better, breathing him in and breathing him out, the scent fading even as I lay there, my chest burning until I couldn’t distinguish among the pains.</div>
<div class="class29">I sat up in the bed after a while and reinserted my cannula and breathed for a while before going up the stairs. I just shook my head no in response to his parents’ expectant looks. The kids raced past me. One of Gus’s sisters—I could not tell them apart—said, “Mom, do you want me to take them to the park or something?”</div>
<div class="class29">“No, no, they’re fine.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Is there anywhere he might have put a notebook? Like by his hospital bed or something?” The bed was already gone, reclaimed by hospice.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel,” his dad said, “you were there every day with us. You— he wasn’t alone much, sweetie. He wouldn’t have had time to write anything. I know you want… I want that, too. But the messages he leaves for us now are coming from <span id="page_291"></span>above, Hazel.” He pointed toward the ceiling, as if Gus were hovering just above the house. Maybe he was. I don’t know. I didn’t feel his presence, though.</div>
<div class="class29">“Yeah,” I said. I promised to visit them again in a few days.</div>
<div class="class29">I never quite caught his scent again.</div>
