<div class="class28">Chapter Eight</div>
<div class="calibre1">We had a big Cancer Team Meeting a couple days later. Every so often, a bunch of doctors and social workers and physical therapists and whoever else got together around a big table in a conference room and discussed my situation. (Not the Augustus Waters situation or the Amsterdam situation. The cancer situation.)</div>
<div class="class29">Dr. Maria led the meeting. She hugged me when I got there. She was a hugger.</div>
<div class="class29">I felt a little better, I guess. Sleeping with the BiPAP all night made my lungs feel almost normal, although, then again, I did not really remember lung normality.</div>
<div class="class29">Everyone got there and made a big show of turning off <span id="page_115"></span>their pagers and everything so it would be <span class="class13">all about me</span>, and then Dr. Maria said, “So the great news is that Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth, but obviously we’re still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation. So the question is, how should we proceed?”</div>
<div class="class29">And then she just looked at me, like she was waiting for an answer. “Um,” I said, “I feel like I am not the most qualified person in the room to answer that question?”</div>
<div class="class29">She smiled. “Right, I was waiting for Dr. Simons. Dr. Simons?” He was another cancer doctor of some kind.</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, we know from other patients that most tumors eventually evolve a way to grow in spite of Phalanxifor, but if that were the case, we’d see tumor growth on the scans, which we don’t see. So it’s not that yet.”</div>
<div class="class29"><span class="class13">Yet</span>, I thought.</div>
<div class="class29">Dr. Simons tapped at the table with his forefinger. “The thought around here is that it’s possible the Phalanxifor is worsening the edema, but we’d face far more serious problems if we discontinued its use.”</div>
<div class="class29">Dr. Maria added, “We don’t really understand the long-term effects of Phalanxifor. Very few people have been on it as long as you have.”</div>
<div class="class29">“So we’re gonna do nothing?”</div>
<div class="class29">“We’re going to stay the course,” Dr. Maria said, “but we’ll need to do more to keep that edema from building up.” I felt kind of sick for some reason, like I was going to <span id="page_116"></span>throw up. I hated Cancer Team Meetings in general, but I hated this one in particular. “Your cancer is not going away, Hazel. But we’ve seen people live with your level of tumor penetration for a long time.” (I did not ask what constituted a long time. I’d made that mistake before.) “I know that coming out of the ICU, it doesn’t feel this way, but this fluid is, at least for the time being, manageable.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Can’t I just get like a lung transplant or something?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">Dr. Maria’s lips shrank into her mouth. “You would not be considered a strong candidate for a transplant, unfortunately,” she said. I understood: No use wasting good lungs on a hopeless case. I nodded, trying not to look like that comment hurt me. My dad started crying a little. I didn’t look over at him, but no one said anything for a long time, so his hiccuping cry was the only sound in the room.</div>
<div class="class29">I hated hurting him. Most of the time, I could forget about it, but the inexorable truth is this: They might be glad to have me around, but I was the alpha and the omega of my parents’ suffering.</div>
<div class="class14">Just before the Miracle, when I was in the ICU and it looked like I was going to die and Mom was telling me it was okay to let go, and I was trying to let go but my lungs kept searching for air, Mom sobbed something into Dad’s chest that I wish I hadn’t heard, and that I hope she never finds <span id="page_117"></span>out that I did hear. She said, “I won’t be a mom anymore.” It gutted me pretty badly.</div>
<div class="class29">I couldn’t stop thinking about that during the whole Cancer Team Meeting. I couldn’t get it out of my head, how she sounded when she said that, like she would never be okay again, which probably she wouldn’t.</div>
<div class="class14">Anyway, eventually we decided to keep things the same only with more frequent fluid drainings. At the end, I asked if I could travel to Amsterdam, and Dr. Simons actually and literally laughed, but then Dr. Maria said, “Why not?” And Simons said, dubiously, “Why not?” And Dr. Maria said, “Yeah, I don’t see why not. They’ve got oxygen on the planes, after all.” Dr. Simons said, “Are they just going to gate-check a BiPAP?” And Maria said, “Yeah, or have one waiting for her.”</div>
<div class="class29">“Placing a patient—one of the most promising Phalanxifor survivors, no less—an eight-hour flight from the only physicians intimately familiar with her case? That’s a recipe for disaster.”</div>
<div class="class29">Dr. Maria shrugged. “It would increase some risks,” she acknowledged, but then turned to me and said, “But it’s your life.”</div>
<div class="class14">Except not really. On the car ride home, my parents agreed: I would not be going to Amsterdam unless and until there was medical agreement that it would be safe<span id="page_118"></span>.</div>
<div class="class14">Augustus called that night after dinner. I was already in bed—after dinner had become my bedtime for the moment—propped up with a gajillion pillows and also Bluie, with my computer on my lap.</div>
<div class="class29">I picked up, saying, “Bad news,” and he said, “Shit, what?”</div>
<div class="class29">“I can’t go to Amsterdam. One of my doctors thinks it’s a bad idea.”</div>
<div class="class29">He was quiet for a second. “God,” he said. “I should’ve just paid for it myself. Should’ve just taken you straight from the <span class="class13">Funky Bones</span> to Amsterdam.”</div>
<div class="class29">“But then I would’ve had a probably fatal episode of deoxygenation in Amsterdam, and my body would have been shipped home in the cargo hold of an airplane,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Well, yeah,” he said. “But before that, my grand romantic gesture would have totally gotten me laid.”</div>
<div class="class29">I laughed pretty hard, hard enough that I felt where the chest tube had been.</div>
<div class="class29">“You laugh because it’s true,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">I laughed again.</div>
<div class="class29">“It’s true, isn’t it!”</div>
<div class="class29">“Probably not,” I said, and then after a moment added, “although you never know.”</div>
<div class="class29">He moaned in misery. “I’m gonna die a virgin,” he said<span id="page_119"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">“You’re a virgin?” I asked, surprised.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel Grace,” he said, “do you have a pen and a piece of paper?” I said I did. “Okay, please draw a circle.” I did. “Now draw a smaller circle within that circle.” I did. “The larger circle is virgins. The smaller circle is seventeen-year-old guys with one leg.”</div>
<div class="class29">I laughed again, and told him that having most of your social engagements occur at a children’s hospital also did not encourage promiscuity, and then we talked about Peter Van Houten’s amazingly brilliant comment about the sluttiness of time, and even though I was in bed and he was in his basement, it really felt like we were back in that uncreated third space, which was a place I really liked visiting with him.</div>
<div class="class29">Then I got off the phone and my mom and dad came into my room, and even though it was really not big enough for all three of us, they lay on either side of the bed with me and we all watched <span class="class13">ANTM</span> on the little TV in my room. This girl I didn’t like, Selena, got kicked off, which made me really happy for some reason. Then Mom hooked me up to the BiPAP and tucked me in, and Dad kissed me on the forehead, the kiss all stubble, and then I closed my eyes.</div>
<div class="class29">The BiPAP essentially took control of my breathing away from me, which was intensely annoying, but the great thing about it was that it made all this noise, rumbling with each inhalation and whirring as I exhaled. I kept thinking <span id="page_120"></span>that it sounded like a dragon breathing in time with me, like I had this pet dragon who was cuddled up next to me and cared enough about me to time his breaths to mine. I was thinking about that as I sank into sleep.</div>
<div class="class14">I got up late the next morning. I watched TV in bed and checked my email and then after a while started crafting an email to Peter Van Houten about how I couldn’t come to Amsterdam but I swore upon the life of my mother that I would never share any information about the characters with anyone, that I didn’t even <span class="class13">want</span> to share it, because I was a terribly selfish person, and could he please just tell me if the Dutch Tulip Man is for real and if Anna’s mom marries him and also about Sisyphus the Hamster.</div>
<div class="class29">But I didn’t send it. It was too pathetic even for me.</div>
<div class="class29">Around three, when I figured Augustus would be home from school, I went into the backyard and called him. As the phone rang, I sat down on the grass, which was all overgrown and dandeliony. That swing set was still back there, weeds growing out of the little ditch I’d created from kicking myself higher as a little kid. I remembered Dad bringing home the kit from Toys “R” Us and building it in the backyard with a neighbor. He’d insisted on swinging on it first to test it, and the thing damn near broke.</div>
<div class="class29">The sky was gray and low and full of rain but not yet raining. I hung up when I got Augustus’s voice mail and <span id="page_121"></span>then put the phone down in the dirt beside me and kept looking at the swing set, thinking that I would give up all the sick days I had left for a few healthy ones. I tried to tell myself that it could be worse, that the world was not a wish-granting factory, that I was living with cancer not dying of it, that I mustn’t let it kill me before it kills me, and then I just started muttering <span class="class13">stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid</span> over and over again until the sound unhinged from its meaning. I was still saying it when he called back.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hi,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hazel Grace,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Hi,” I said again.</div>
<div class="class29">“Are you crying, Hazel Grace?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Kind of?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Why?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“’Cause I’m just—I want to go to Amsterdam, and I want him to tell me what happens after the book is over, and I just don’t want my particular life, and also the sky is depressing me, and there is this old swing set out here that my dad made for me when I was a kid.”</div>
<div class="class29">“I must see this old swing set of tears immediately,” he said. “I’ll be over in twenty minutes.”</div>
<div class="class14">I stayed in the backyard because Mom was always really smothery and concerned when I was crying, because I did not cry often, and I knew she’d want to <span class="class13">talk</span> and discuss <span id="page_122"></span>whether I shouldn’t consider adjusting my medication, and the thought of that whole conversation made me want to throw up.</div>
<div class="class29">It’s not like I had some utterly poignant, well-lit memory of a healthy father pushing a healthy child and the child saying <span class="class13">higher higher higher</span> or some other metaphorically resonant moment. The swing set was just sitting there, abandoned, the two little swings hanging still and sad from a grayed plank of wood, the outline of the seats like a kid’s drawing of a smile.</div>
<div class="class29">Behind me, I heard the sliding-glass door open. I turned around. It was Augustus, wearing khaki pants and a short-sleeve plaid button-down. I wiped my face with my sleeve and smiled. “Hi,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">It took him a second to sit down on the ground next to me, and he grimaced as he landed rather ungracefully on his ass. “Hi,” he said finally. I looked over at him. He was looking past me, into the backyard. “I see your point,” he said as he put an arm around my shoulder. “That is one sad goddamned swing set.”</div>
<div class="class29">I nudged my head into his shoulder. “Thanks for offering to come over.”</div>
<div class="class29">“You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“I guess?” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“All efforts to save me from you will fail,” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Why? Why would you even like me? Haven’t you put <span id="page_123"></span>yourself through enough of this?” I asked, thinking of Caroline Mathers.</div>
<div class="class29">Gus didn’t answer. He just held on to me, his fingers strong against my left arm. “We gotta do something about this frigging swing set,” he said. “I’m telling you, it’s ninety percent of the problem.”</div>
<div class="class14">Once I’d recovered, we went inside and sat down on the couch right next to each other, the laptop half on his (fake) knee and half on mine. “Hot,” I said of the laptop’s base.</div>
<div class="class29">“Is it now?” He smiled. Gus loaded this giveaway site called Free No Catch and together we wrote an ad.</div>
<div class="class29">“Headline?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“‘Swing Set Needs Home,’” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“‘Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home,’” he said.</div>
<div class="class29">“‘Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks the Butts of Children,’” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">He laughed. “That’s why.”</div>
<div class="class29">“What?”</div>
<div class="class29">“That’s why I like you. Do you realize how rare it is to come across a hot girl who creates an adjectival version of the word <span class="class13">pedophile</span>? You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.”</div>
<div class="class29">I took a deep breath through my nose. There was never enough air in the world, but the shortage was particularly acute in that moment<span id="page_124"></span>.</div>
<div class="class29">We wrote the ad together, editing each other as we went. In the end, we settled upon this:</div>
<div class="class41">Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home</div>
<div class="class32">One swing set, well worn but structurally sound, seeks new home. Make memories with your kid or kids so that someday he or she or they will look into the backyard and feel the ache of sentimentality as desperately as I did this afternoon. It’s all fragile and fleeting, dear reader, but with this swing set, your child(ren) will be introduced to the ups and downs of human life gently and safely, and may also learn the most important lesson of all: No matter how hard you kick, no matter how high you get, you can’t go all the way around.</div>
<div class="class33">Swing set currently resides near 83rd and Spring Mill.</div>
<div class="calibre1">After that, we turned on the TV for a little while, but we couldn’t find anything to watch, so I grabbed <span class="class13">An Imperial Affliction</span> off the bedside table and brought it back into the living room and Augustus Waters read to me while Mom, making lunch, listened in.</div>
<div class="class29"><span class="class13">“‘Mother’s glass eye turned inward,’”</span> Augustus began. As <span id="page_125"></span>he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.</div>
<div class="class14">When I checked my email an hour later, I learned that we had plenty of swing-set suitors to choose from. In the end, we picked a guy named Daniel Alvarez who’d included a picture of his three kids playing video games with the subject line <span class="class13">I just want them to go outside</span>. I emailed him back and told him to pick it up at his leisure.</div>
<div class="class29">Augustus asked if I wanted to go with him to Support Group, but I was really tired from my busy day of Having Cancer, so I passed. We were sitting there on the couch together, and he pushed himself up to go but then fell back down onto the couch and sneaked a kiss onto my cheek.</div>
<div class="class29">“Augustus!” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Friendly,” he said. He pushed himself up again and really stood this time, then took two steps over to my mom and said, “Always a pleasure to see you,” and my mom opened her arms to hug him, whereupon Augustus leaned in and kissed my mom on the cheek. He turned back to me. “See?” he asked.</div>
<div class="class29">I went to bed right after dinner, the BiPAP drowning out the world beyond my room.</div>
<div class="class29">I never saw the swing set again.</div>
<div class="class14">I slept for a long time, ten hours, possibly because of the slow recovery and possibly because sleep fights cancer and <span id="page_126"></span>possibly because I was a teenager with no particular wake-up time. I wasn’t strong enough yet to go back to classes at MCC. When I finally felt like getting up, I removed the BiPAP snout from my nose, put my oxygen nubbins in, turned them on, and then grabbed my laptop from beneath my bed, where I’d stashed it the night before.</div>
<div class="class29">I had an email from Lidewij Vliegenthart.</div>
<div class="class31">Dear Hazel,</div>
<div class="class32">I have received word via the Genies that you will be visiting us with Augustus Waters and your mother beginning on 4th of May. Only a week away! Peter and I are delighted and cannot wait to make your acquaintance. Your hotel, the Filosoof, is just one street away from Peter’s home. Perhaps we should give you one day for the jet lag, yes? So if convenient, we will meet you at Peter’s home on the morning of 5th May at perhaps ten o’clock for a cup of coffee and for him to answer questions you have about his book. And then perhaps afterward we can tour a museum or the Anne Frank House?</div>
<div class="class33">With all best wishes,<br class="calibre1"/>Lidewij Vliegenthart<br class="calibre1"/>Executive Assistant to Mr. Peter Van Houten,<br class="calibre1"/>author of <span class="class13">An Imperial Afflictio<span id="page_127"></span>n</span></div>
<div class="calibre1">“Mom,” I said. She didn’t answer. “MOM!” I shouted. Nothing. Again, louder, “MOM!”</div>
<div class="class29">She ran in wearing a threadbare pink towel under her armpits, dripping, vaguely panicked. “What’s wrong?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Nothing. Sorry, I didn’t know you were in the shower,” I said.</div>
<div class="class29">“Bath,” she said. “I was just…” She closed her eyes. “Just trying to take a bath for five seconds. Sorry. What’s going on?”</div>
<div class="class29">“Can you call the Genies and tell them the trip is off? I just got an email from Peter Van Houten’s assistant. She thinks we’re coming.”</div>
<div class="class29">She pursed her lips and squinted past me.</div>
<div class="class29">“What?” I asked.</div>
<div class="class29">“I’m not supposed to tell you until your father gets home.”</div>
<div class="class29"><span class="class13">“What?”</span> I asked again.</div>
<div class="class29">“Trip’s on,” she said finally. “Dr. Maria called us last night and made a convincing case that you need to live your—”</div>
<div class="class29">“MOM, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!” I shouted, and she came to the bed and let me hug her.</div>
<div class="class29">I texted Augustus because I knew he was in school:</div>
<div class="class37">Still free May three? :-<span id="page_128"></span>)</div>
<div class="calibre1">He texted back immediately.</div>
<div class="class37">Everything’s coming up Waters.</div>
<div class="calibre1">If I could just stay alive for a week, I’d know the unwritten secrets of Anna’s mom and the Dutch Tulip Guy. I looked down my blouse at my chest.</div>
<div class="class29">“Keep your shit together,” I whispered to my lungs.</div>
