<p id="c13-para-0026" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.90.1">My hope with this chapter is that you will never look at YouTube the same. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.90.2">As you watch videos, you'll train yourself to analyze every element, looking for patterns of narration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.90.3">You'll learn how important storytelling is and how to emotionally connect with your audience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.90.4">But I also want you to recognize all the little details in a video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.90.5">The little details help you create content that really pops, details like camera angles and movement, time lapses and zooms, pattern interrupts, music, reactions, and editing techniques. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.90.6">Let me share with you an example of a creator who really knows how to make content pop.</span></p>
<p id="c13-para-0027" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.1">I have worked with YouTuber MrBeast on a lot of YouTube videos and other projects, and I can tell you that his success is no accident. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.2">He is so thoughtful and methodical about every tiny detail in his content. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.3">He plans out all the elements of title, thumbnail, story arc, camera work, and every other little thing a creator could possibly think of when making a new video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.4">MrBeast creates multiple title and thumbnail combinations, and films multiple options for different scenes in every video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.5">His storyline is clear, his hook is bold and simple, and his reengagements are off the charts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.6">He zooms, pans, and shoots from different perspectives. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.91.7">He edits with continuous reengagement in mind, doing quick cuts and fast paces because he knows that's what works with his audience.</span></p>
<p id="c13-para-0028" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.92.1">He also keeps storylines simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.92.2">This content creation skill is highly overlooked and undervalued by most YouTube creators, but it's what sets great creators apart from the masses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.92.3">If MrBeast can't explain a video concept in one sentence, he labels it as too complicated and scratches it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.92.4">Some of these videos could have made him a </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_164" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="164" class="calibre16"></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.93.1">lot of money, but he won't use it if it doesn't pass the one‐sentence test. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.93.2">What he does do with these rejected videos is make them into a compilation video that he shows his reactions to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.93.3">This way it's not wasted time, money, and content.</span></p>
<p id="c13-para-0029" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.1">MrBeast knows how to make content pop. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.2">Case in point: he shot a video titled “I Opened a Free Car Dealership” (note the title less than 50 characters, easy to remember, and simple to explain), and the first thing he said was, “I bought every single car at a car dealership.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.3">This sentence flashes across the black screen in bold letters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.4">We already know exactly what this video is going to be about: MrBeast bought a bunch of cars and he's going to give them away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.5">Simple concept, masterful execution. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.6">MrBeast then shows himself buying the cars, which took a while in real life but about five seconds of video time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.7">In this opening segment, camera angles switch multiple times, there's a quick time lapse, and there's comic relief including facial expressions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.8">The content is already popping. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.9">Then MrBeast walks through the lot to take inventory of his newly purchased vehicles and changes the windshield pricing to absurdly low numbers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.10">Hooked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.94.11">This all happens in 45 seconds.</span></p>
<p id="c13-para-0030" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.95.1">This video is nearly 17 minutes long, and you will want to watch it from start to finish if you go find it on YouTube. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.95.2">MrBeast is a wizard at reengagement strategies—he uses comic and emotional relief, camera work, and editing techniques to retain his audience and maximize his pattern of narration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.95.3">MrBeast's retention timing is impeccable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.95.4">He's listed the first car to sell for three dollars, but when the buyers sit down to sign the “paperwork” (which is a stack of crossword puzzles and word searches), he says, “We ran a 33% off sale, so it's now two dollars.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.95.5">All the while he's using zoom work, fast‐paced editing, sound effects, and words on the screen to continuously reengage.</span></p>

<p id="c13-para-0031" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.97.1">There is an important point to make here: this video seems to work because of sensationalism—MrBeast buys 12 cars and documents his silly antics to give them all away—but something happens outside of the sensation and the silliness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.97.2">We see the happiness and gratitude of the people who receive the free cars, and we see MrBeast feeling really good about helping people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.97.3">It's genuine, and MrBeast, it turns out, is a genuinely good guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.97.4">When your viewers emotionally connect, you have told a good story.</span></p>
<p id="c13-para-0032" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.98.1">By the end of the car giveaway video, you'll find that you've smiled, laughed, and maybe even cried, so when MrBeast drops his call to action to buy his merchandise so he can continue spreading good in the world, you really want to click. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.98.2">Whether you'll click on the merchandise button or the next MrBeast video, he's got you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.98.3">His masterful storytelling and content creation strategies worked like a charm.</span></p>
<p id="c13-para-0033" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.99.1">If you grabbed a pen and paper and binge‐watched MrBeast's channel with content creation techniques in mind, you would end up with a really long list of practices that pop. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.99.2">You can do this with any great content creators; they all use these techniques meticulously and generously with good reason: they work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.99.3">Ask yourself what elements you already use and if you can use them better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.99.4">Then take note of the elements you don't use that you need to implement in future content creation.</span></p>
