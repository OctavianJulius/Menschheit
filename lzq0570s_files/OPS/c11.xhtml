<p id="c11-para-0010" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.1">Devin's audience was maxed out with the kind of content that he was creating, and if he wanted to get a bigger audience, he had to change his content to reach people outside of the law student demographic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.2">I asked him to reiterate why he wanted to make videos in the first place, and he said he just wanted to share his passion for the law and help people understand law better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.3">So the follow‐up question was: How can you help more people outside of law school understand the law? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.4">The answer we came up with was to use law‐related TV shows and movies a mainstream audience already enjoyed watching and deconstruct them in a “Real Lawyer Reacts to …” format. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.5">He already had one video in this format, but he needed to create more in this series. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.6">He also created an original true crime special. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.23.7">He was still reaching his original viewer, but he had found a way to appeal to a pop culture viewer as well. </span><i class="calibre6"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.24.1">Legal Eagle</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.25.1"> now has more than a million subscribers and a hundred million views. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.25.2">Devin figured out how to </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_131" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="131" class="calibre16"></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.26.1">cross his passion with his audience, but the real sweet spot came when he added the third dimension: the mainstream/pop culture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.26.2">Take a look at the Venn diagram in </span><a href="#c11-fig-0002" id="R_c11-fig-0002" class="calibre5"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.27.1">Figure 11.2</span></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.28.1"> to see exactly what I mean.</span></p>
