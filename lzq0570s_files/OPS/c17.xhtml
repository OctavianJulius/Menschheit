<p id="c17-para-0021" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.1">Once, I had a client who wrote a list of about 40 of their most frequently asked questions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.2">Forty sounds like a great list, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.3">Well, to get the most out of this exercise, you have to go way beyond FAQs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.4">So after he had his 40 down, I had him think about every possible question he had ever been asked and had him add them all to his list. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.5">He ended up with more than 250 questions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.6">Now you can sort your list according to which questions come up the most. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.7">Then you are ready to create content that answers all of the questions your potential viewer might ask in Search, giving the most asked questions priority. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.8">If your content pops up at the top of the results, viewers are more likely to click on your video, and you're more likely to have gained another viewer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.62.9">You also need to consider that YouTube is owned by Google, so your content needs to show up in a Google search as well, because your traffic could come from there.</span></p>

<p id="c17-para-0047" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.1">Three days before the NCAA championship, we did a subreddit post with the Scott Sterling video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.2">Soccer fans who saw it knew it was fake, but they loved it because it was so funny. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.3">And because it was soccer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.4">This exposure and momentum helped the post land on the front page of Reddit, and it was shared and reshared elsewhere online. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.5">We got 12 million views in less than 24 hours. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.6">It catapulted the small channel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.7">Within a few days, a rumor started circulating that the goalie had died from his injuries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.8">Of course, this wasn't true, but it continued to generate buzz for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.111.9">This video release strategy hit a double‐whammy tent pole: we timed it around the US national soccer championship, but also we appealed to a worldwide soccer audience.</span></p>
<p id="c17-para-0048" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.112.1">Let's go back to the soccer video we talked about in collaborations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.112.2">Dan Markham used the help of his soccer friend Garrett to make an interesting video about World Cup soccer balls, which he eventually cut open at the end of the video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.112.3">You already know that this was a successful collaboration strategy, but Dan's content release strategy is very important for us to talk about as a tent pole as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.112.4">Dan had filmed this video in January, but the World Cup tournament wasn't until June, so he just let the video sit.</span></p>

<p id="c17-para-0050" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.114.1">Tent poling is a really smart tactic to add to your overall content strategy, especially because the content is usually evergreen, meaning that that content gets a boost every time that event comes back around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.114.2">Mine your video archives to see what content you've already made that might fit into a tent pole strategy, then make new content with data relationships connecting these videos. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.114.3">I promise it works for topics besides soccer!</span></p>
