<p id="c05-para-0002" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.4.1">YouTube provides a place for people to share their passion with the world, and this is great, but do you know what is also great? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.4.2">When people get compensated for their passion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.4.3">Making money is not a bad thing. </span><i class="calibre6"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.5.1">This is why we are here, folks</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.6.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.6.2">You can spread your passion and make money doing it without being a sell‐out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.6.3">In fact, the more money you make, the more you can spread your message to the world.</span></p>

<p id="c05-para-0006" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.1">Most creators I work with have a handle on knowing what they are supposed to be doing, but they continue to put out content with the assumption that something will magically start working or suddenly attract an audience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.2">This just isn't how YouTube works. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.3">Taking this approach leads to frustration and self‐created hurdles that stop or slow you down from getting to your goal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.4">Your first step to YouTube success might be to admit that your content is not working. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.5">Take a giant step back right now and ask yourself if you are actually happy with your content. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.6">Are you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.7">Is it working? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.8">Do you know why it's not? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.9">One way to look at it is through the eyes of your potential viewer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.10.10">Do you think they would watch your video, or even just half of your video?</span></p>
<p id="c05-para-0007" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.11.1">As a company, YouTube is a prime example of learning from things that aren't working. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.11.2">Remember that it started as a dating </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_43" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="43" class="calibre16"></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.1">website and changed based on “failure” feedback. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.2">They couldn't get women to post on their website even when they offered $20 a video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.3">The dating website didn't work, so they changed the website to what its users wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.4">If what you're doing hasn't been working, be willing to change it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.5">Some creators who have been on YouTube a while often get trapped in old habits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.6">If you fall within the “old YouTuber” category, reassess your ideology and methodology. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.7">Holding on to outdated processes and ideas could be what's been holding you back from seeing real growth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.8">Just because something used to work for your content doesn't mean it will work forever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.12.9">Don't be afraid to shed the “old” YouTube and look at how current successful creators are doing things.</span></p>
<p id="c05-para-0008" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.13.1">The next step is accepting the fact that the data does not lie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.13.2">Maybe your mom tells you that your videos are amazing, but have you considered that she might be the only one who thinks so? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.13.3">I can't help but think of those unfortunate American Idol hopefuls who walk into the room of judges with their mama's glowing compliments on their shoulders only to be escorted out of the room after an audience‐cringing performance and a harsh critique from Simon Cowell.</span></p>
<p id="c05-para-0009" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.14.1">The good news for you is that you can learn how to analyze data and create amazing content a lot easier than a bad singer can learn how to find perfect pitch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.14.2">It's all about the data. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.14.3">You have to be willing to become a student of the data.</span></p>

<p id="c05-para-0034" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.74.1">Some creators think there is a YouTube wizard behind a curtain somewhere pulling levers and calling all the shots, controlling content at his whim and pleasure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.74.2">Of course, you have already learned that this is not true, because you have become an analytical student of YouTube who knows that the data doesn't lie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.74.3">But others continue to waste time and energy on things that don't matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.74.4">Let me tell you a story to expound.</span></p>
<p id="c05-para-0035" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.75.1">There was a woman who cut both ends off a pot roast before putting it into her roasting pan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.75.2">She did this for years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.75.3">One day, her husband asked her why she did it, and she said it was the way her mother had always done it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.75.4">So the husband went to his mother‐in‐law and asked her the same question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.75.5">She replied, “Because my roasting pan was too small to fit a whole pot roast.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.75.6">The wife's roasting pan was big enough to fit an entire pot roast all along, and she had been doing the task unnecessarily for years (not to mention she was wasting perfectly good meat).</span></p>
<p id="c05-para-0036" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.76.1">Similarly, creators expend a lot of wasted energy when they don't know there is a better way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.76.2">For example, there was a time on YouTube when there was a glitch in the scheduling feature, so channel subscribers weren't getting notified about new scheduled uploads. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.76.3">Creators started uploading manually because they thought it was the only way to get around the problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.76.4">The glitch was fixed, but a lot of creators continued to think it was broken. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.76.5">They believed this for years and were slaves to the clock. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.76.6">No matter what it interfered </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_53" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="53" class="calibre16"></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.77.1">with—sleep, day job, family obligations—they stuck to manual uploading. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.77.2">YouTube's fixed scheduling tool would have saved them so much frustration, but they just didn't use it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.77.3">Imagine how much of their energy and time could have been spent elsewhere.</span></p>
<p id="c05-para-0037" class="calibre14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.78.1">If you are cutting off both ends of your pot roast, so to speak, know why you're doing it, and if you don't like it, explore your options. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="kobospan" id="kobo.78.2">Maybe there is already a solution, but you just don't know about it yet.</span></p>
